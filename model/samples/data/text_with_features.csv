2,386,"might have pulled something that I'm going to bring the great thanks so much and please are you okay with this yes oh I'm fine I'm a little tired but I found out my thyroid is I think acting up so where are you from originally I was born in Canada but I've lived in California most of my life so and it's gray today too so the gray weather makes you kind of see no sluggish oh my gosh years and years ago not at all I don't think I can text to her for a long time well the air fares have gone up quite a bit in the last few years gas prices have gone up so travel as much as it's a fun thing to do it's cost-prohibitive so oh that's see everything has plus and minuses cold-weather not as much sun so I think I'd prefer getting more sun and having the warm-weather so but other than that it's it's very pretty back their natural scenery in but I like it here you know the traffic is kind of heavy but that's a small thing to deal with why did I move to LA because my family came here and started to my dad got a job here and thus became our home base and that's why easy very easy sew well in high school you generally study General Ed they have designated courses and then after that went to college and I was a business major let's say I was a Veterinary major and I graduated with a degree in Liberal Arts so I don't know can't really pinpoint I was working in Social Services but I've also worked in sales and most recently I'm doing real estate, leasing consultant part-time I mean everything has plus and minuses it's it's okay it's not I don't really see too many negatives oh probably to work as a gossip columnist it TMZ or one of those networks but as you know everything in the entertainment business is very competitive it's who you know so but that would be my dream job or probably working with cats you know animals so I'm very outgoing in fact I think I'm so echoing I scare people sometimes there's a lot of quiet you know Reserve people out there so I'm kind of East Coast very you know I go up to people and talk to them first social sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver oh my gosh there's I could do hundreds of things I could read I could watch a show turn on the music music is great take a walk call my friends million things so I'm pretty good I'm very good I mean you know of course when you're driving in LA and somebody cuts in front of you sometimes I can be irritating but I'm I'm actually pretty I'm not the type of person that will fighter jet I don't like to have confrontations so I can't really remember so that's why I said there's not very many arguments usually I avoid arguments at any cost so do you feel guilty about I don't really feel guilty about anything right now or that I can think of I can't think of anything right now I really can't think of any decisions that were really hard I mean most of it's pretty easy for make me to make a decision so I don't have a family so if I have to you know I had to moves to San Francisco for a job once but since I'm single it's I don't really have to consider other people and children and that type of thing so kind of makes certain things easier when you don't have other family to consider yeah in advance well obviously you don't you know the passing of a family member you know you wish everybody could be around forever so I know when my father died you know I mean I wish I would have had him for a lot longer and he died at the age of 77 and you know what have been nice to have him around a little bit more but you know I can't control those things life has its own way of dealing with that yes there are Yin and Yang that's ancient philosophy and it really applies here is pluses and minuses the negatives and positives so well like I said my dad's no longer here and my mother and I you know we have our differences I think mothers and daughters always do my brother and I get along great I see him a lot my sister works a lot I see her and you know we talked and she's kind of got her own life and her children I get along great with them so we have a small family once again it's like that's a hard question to answer there's so many types of kids up there I think majority of them seem to be pretty well-behaved I mean you know there's always going to be children that are cut out of control but I don't know the ones that I've seen recently the very well behaved so can't say much else about that well I live in an apartment and I don't know if you've ever lived in apartment but there's someone that lives above me I'm on the first floor and there's somebody on the second floor and they're pretty quiet but they have a habit of I guess they have lots of energy they usually will take their showers around midnight and sometimes I'll start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes run through the bedroom wall so it sounds like Niagara Falls and they are and so I don't ya and I need 8 hours of sleep and I've only been getting oh I'd say like maybe 6 hours and then I usually wake up once at night take a sometimes they'll kind of around 2 or 3 in the morning go either walk around or I'll hear something so I'm not getting a straight 8 hours of sleep and it's definitely but there's not like I said there's things you can't control when you live in an apartment you know I means that the ladies look very quiet it just that she has a habit of you know taking later showers question close at night that's I can't say anything to her about that yeah but you know there's people that are in worse situations so I don't make a lot out of it you know and I just it's not like every night but it's you know at least twice a week so you know I have to consider sleeping in another room but for now you know that's I'll deal with it so tired very tired and hard to focus hard to concentrate it just takes me longer to get things done cuz I don't have my energy also I haven't been exercising I normally try to walk about half an hour a day but the weather's been kind of colder and kind of dreary or so you know I'm not as motivated when the weather is kind of blah so it's a combination of both not getting my exercise not getting 8 hours sleep how you been feeling lately as I said before tire has a combination of the weather you know I'm here in Los Angeles right now we have been having very gray days I live very close to the ocean so the sun doesn't come out that much so I'm not getting my serotonin I need that I am I getting my 8 hours of sleep because you know whatever and I think my thyroid is acting up too so that's kind of creating you know I have some vitamin deficiencies and you know once the Sun comes out I'm kind of more energetic it just gives you that more energy have you ever been diagnosed with p no no I hope I'm happy most of the time I'm a pretty happy person and I like to be around other people I mean of course I like my private time but I do like being around people quite a bit so can't think of anything right now I mean I usually enjoy everything I do there's nothing that stands out more than anything else okay is there anything you regret know I never regret anything what advice would I have given well I guess yeah I could probably change things around I think it everybody could I probably would have had a different college major in a seems like what else I probably wouldn't have dated certain waste of time with certain people I don't know those are them things that come to mind maybe started saving money earlier you know those types of things but how your best friend in Spanish outgoing lots of fun to be with just a good friend to have people like having me for a friend I'm loyal trusting and I listen I'm a good listener I'm very patient as well so what are some things you wish you could change about yourself well I never wanted me to lose weight but I think that's a worldwide problem I mean there's a lot of food around and temptations and especially here in America a lot of us are couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we you know it's just easy to real it's so easy to relax you know it's hard to get up and move around you have to talk yourself into it so that's the way that you know house gives you more energy to if you lose weight so that's a big thing as well but that's probably the thing just the weight thing you I understand how do your best friend describe you I think you might have asked me that question before her but if you want I'll repeat it so I'm very like I said I'm very loyal when I tell people I'm going to do something I do it very reliable I am warm I'm very friendly great listener and I mean I've heard so many people tell me they just like being with me so like I said I'm very I'm pretty upbeat you know I'm don't let things get me down too much so how have in your life that's a hard question that can't think I mean I'm can't think of the answer that way so 4fun well I love movies so I could see every movie that they make I love going out with my friends shopping swap meets my gosh and traveling is great road trips that's kind of we know part of it yeah that I mentioned so traveling getting to see different places the history aspect of it the foods and joined Foods in different countries the architecture it's just kind of need to get away and see a completely different place okay well I've been to a lot of places in Europe I love Paris is such a walking City you can whoever designed that City I'll tell you I mean it's you can get from one point to another the Subways are great each area has its own distinctive kind of there's the Latin quarter where the students are there is another area where let's say the fashion designers are kind of like our Rodeo Drive here in Beverly Hills there's an area that is more African and they have swap meets in the weekends that are wonderful is for international and then like I said when she get out of Paris there's just so much history you can go see Versailles there's other palaces you can go to the south of France you know but that's probably my favorite country I've been to Italy as well so yeah well after college people usually many people that go to college or either before or after college that's a great time to go to Europe because you're young and you're not tied down you don't have a family and you kind of have a more adventuresome Spirit you got more energy so carrying you know backpack or suitcases it's not not a big deal so yeah that's thank you goodbye oh that was that was fast but I didn't never said there wasn't any like shocking question never know I guess with very gradually rising, trembling, very low, very small pitched voice",0

11,396,"okay thank you thanks for coming in today created to talk to people and it stays are you okay with yes okay Virginia I wanted to live somewhere different than Virginia with a little bit more of diversity once a year maybe add song it's a lot slower and there's a lot left to do there I wanted to live somewhere different and a nicer warmer climate and somewhere where there's a lot more to do and I was a lot more going on for me it was really easy cuz I wanted some it was very different and I wanted something different I like I like all the things to do like the Museum's I like the beaches in the mountains and all the hiking and all the free things to do people don't appreciate what they have here that just come here and want to take something but they don't want to give anything back in bad drivers I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot not as much as I'd like to I travel whenever I can but usually can't afford to you that much well I like taking I like taking pictures a lot and I just like exploring new places my wife and I like to see you wildlife and Hiking monuments and to seeing different areas well we we've got we went to Central California we'd like to be able to go more internationally places but that takes a while to afford so we've gone more locally so we went to we went to Hearst Castle in the C the C the elephant seals and things like that I guess I guess our Palm Springs trip for our anniversary we did the who did the tram in the nice hotel on the jacuzzi and romantic dinner and it was a good time overall guess somewhere in between English and film well I am was told I needed to go to college in I haven't quite decided what to do yet so I just pick something I like to do for the time being well wish I had not been pressured so I had more time to figure out what I wanted to I might have done something different like Physical Therapy but are you still working or not I know I've been teaching gymnastics which is something I used to do before what made you decide to do that I needed to not starve and it did it it didn't end up being as bad as I thought it would be so I went for it and ended up being kind of fun dream job is to have money and not have to work for it okay how are you at controlling your temper overall pretty gif I don't remember what about but it probably would have been few weeks ago with my wife all anyone that I've ever actually gotten upset and yelled always wish I wouldn't do that but sometimes when someone is not listening it drives me crazy now if I just saying something over and over and they're just clearly not listening it makes me really upset tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to me I don't know I I spent a lot of time on them but I don't I don't know what the hardest one is cuz it if I decide to go with something and you know it's usually for a good reason what's something you feel guilty about well I guess I feel guilty about moving to California in that I left my family and Virginia I mean I know I shouldn't but they always seem to miss me and even though they don't like living there you know I'm the one that moved away so it's like I abandoned them well I mean I don't miss Virginia but I do miss them so I guess a little hard I have a good relationship with my with my wife with my in-laws with my mom dad and sister there's no problems everyone gets along well very close mean anything anything where someone gets hurt either physically or otherwise depends on how much exercise I have get a lot of exercise is pretty easy if I don't it's not kind of like right now just a little bit swelling out of it but not really too different otherwise how do you been feeling lately I'm just kind of run-down cuz my um my mother-in-law's is dying and we just spent like 3 days in the hospital and we're going to go back after this so not a lot of time to sleep just some just us just slower and more tired and a little more out of it that's all have you ever been tigers no now usually just when I'm having having a fun day either on my own or with my wife that's it's pretty easy for me just getting outside and and and Hiking or exercising not hard for me I'm not sure maybe I'm maybe like eccentric but in a good way hopefully is there anything you regret no 2 be careful with your to be careful with your job to make sure you could keep from being injured and two I don't know just just your normal your normal kind of older kind of wisdom can you tell me about that not much just a really everyone realizes things when they get older they wish they had when they were younger what are some things you wish you can change about yourself I wish I could get rid of my back injury so I could get back into shape like I used to be at some the biggest thing right now not much to say just hurt my back at work and I just like to get past it cuz it's you know holding me back from doing a lot of things that's all smile like you used to do gymnastics and trampoline and used to be a lot more active or work out more and now I can only work out a little bit cuz it hurts too much tell me how you spend your ideal weekend probably like during that during the day going going on a hike or to a park with my wife and enjoying taking pictures and Wildlife and exercising and then at night you know if we watch a movie or go dancing or just something like that is proud of them proud of moving here and then I came here without knowing anyone and I was at a point where I could have stayed in Virginia and

thing people are friendly finding out some things about my grandmother and her family were interesting I studied poli-sci and sociology what's the time it seemed like the easiest thing to do now now I have a dream job for a while I was doing sports research for our Native American tribes but I enjoyed it but that's so it's not as as often as it was mainly because of the the Sports Bureau that exist now that didn't exist when I started Crystal when I do I still enjoy it I'll be with it but I'll be with suits me in any given situation you intend I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got what do you do listen music I like oldies Jazz soft music I've learned it well I have a question I was at Wayne but I've learned to do it well might want to bug you a super mean words but with my youngest daughter it was about a year-and-a-half ago can you tell me about where was stand over an incident I didn't like the way your husband said something to her and it bothered me and when I told her she got it extremely defensive and rather than deal with her when she became she became angry with me I was mad three girls 38-37 31 three granddaughters 11-14-18 so I haven't won an argument a long time but I adore all six of them when I don't really consider myself a parent just wanna grow my baby's 31 and you never lose that but I'm in my parenting at this point in my life I'm enjoying my grandchildren when I was a parent that's a difficult job getting getting to their level and understanding what they understand I don't understand and that putting your your stuff in front of theirs hugs well my dad was with physical and those days you know nobody called Child Services if you got hit my mother was very loving you but my dad I adored my mother my dad that was a hard guy but I love him I never felt abused by him but I mean I'm the one thing I remember you said when you when you're capable of kicking my ass you can leave this house that's my hope that Skyler the bases of a relationship okay my mother my kids my grandkids I'm one of them one of the three three sons really didn't have any experience with the females other than with my mother in terms of being the unrelated and my grandma and my first daughter was born I was like why was it so I'm madly in love with her change my life that's what happened when my mother got sick I wish I wasn't there for her the way she should have been but I don't feel good oh yeah you can always fix what you do with you I was just in a real bad situation but that doesn't excuse the fact that I wasn't there the way I should have been at least I Did It My Way why my second marriage probably she she wanted to have children already had my children with my first wife and I had told her initially that I did not want to have children that you know I'm going to head 3 and I was good with that and she indicated that she did not want to have children so we got married and then her best friend guy pregnant and our relationship changed and I basically wouldn't relent and we had to get a divorce I don't know what I would have had to it would have would have had children with her but I I wasn't very flexible in the process what to be flexible sometimes I am sometimes or no I've been pulled my boy my father out of off of life support what made you decide to do that I just keep going back to something he said to me when I was younger that he would come back and haunt me and if I do know if I let him Lay It lay there and suffer took me a while to convince my other two brothers but that's what we do can I get erased from my memory being locked up for a while like erase it from my memory it's an everyday hell where there's very little Humanity and you got to do some things that you're not proud of how easy is it I've never slept I'm never slept a lot and I'm one of those people that if I wake up I have a hard time going back to sleep so it's best if I'm really tired than you know what are you I'm pretty much so with the same oil change socialite things are good with the kids and the grandkids except for the live incident with my granddaughter Midol youngest daughter but I had a friend recently who was runned over in a crosswalk and then he's on he's on life support Simon feeling too good about that it's it's affected me was like he was jaywalking and he literally was walking in the crosswalk and the guy never even hit the brakes o and he's on that life support at this point have you noticed any changes in your behavior or soccer no not really because that's the thing about me is I'm very inconsistent no no but I've had moments when I thought I was I was depressed okay I was talk to you when you were talking to any other question yesterday had a conversation with my 14 year old granddaughter I'm happy I have moments of Happiness everyday cuz I either speak to text with my daughters and granddaughters everything even if we're upset with one another I have a lot of regrets can you give me an I should have went to law school that's that's kind of something I thought you were going to think about more in my lifetime it was accepted I just didn't I had other other things I thought I wanted to do I played with those wanting to be a kicker for football on the football team and had some tryouts things like that but didn't pan out and that is as that didn't pan out I sort of lost my zest for wanting to be a lawyer we just did other things I'll take a big that was different I probably would listen to myself by myself I could be if I don't like you I can be very very difficult if I don't like you I'd very much like to change that it has in the past year well I just threw that you can make me feel bad about myself only if I let you and I'm not real big on letting people do that to me on my first wife when when she left me with the children she you know that it was my fault and I wasn't sure that I believe that but I knew I was an ass and and so I probably believed it and not in its totality but in part I'm very I'm not judgemental I will listen to anybody but that I agree with you or disagree with you I've taught myself to control anger that I that I have and if if I call you my friend or if I tell you I love you and I mean it that's that's not something that I do casually okay why I play 18 holes of golf with it with an old dear friend we got caught up and 4 hours on the golf course 2 hours at dinner that is your wife have a good time a lot a lot of memories came in why am I not like my grandkids I like that you know I like the hell out of them I don't have all kids in like that I think they're like too much on that rely too much on technology but but that's me mainly cuz I don't but if my grandkids are any any sampling of it I think they're good think they're pretty good I raised my girls basically by myself with the help of my mother I think that's the thing I'm most proud of okay nice chatting with

as my parents Ethiopia yes the beaches warm weather the diverse environment traffic well I'm currently in school I'm studying African studies how did you decide I've always been interested in African studies actually was wanted to help people and I figure that I can help them by trying to learn about it and going back to Africa making influence kind of in-between I have my shy moments but then when I'm around a group of people that Angela I'm pretty outgoing hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the interacts I normally write or I go to the beach and just sit there and play My Guitar pretty good I don't really get angry or anything like that I tend to keep it in or try to release it by writing when was the I actually can't remember the last time I argue with someone okay what's something you feel guilty about all the people I've hurt in the past can you tell me about well I've like cheated on people hurt their feelings intentionally some things I should have done that I regret now well with my ex I could have ended it better so we could be on better terms now and I probably shouldn't have argue so much as try to instigate so many things I probably should have just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out hardest decision I've ever had to make was man I really don't know actually having to see my dad go through surgery and see him suffer well he had a tumor that had to get removed so it's just hard seeing him have to be in the bed and just be in the hospital when he really don't want to be there cuz he's a really live person and he'd rather be running around and stuff like that but just saying I'm stuck in bed and was just terrible tell me about your relationship with your me and my family are very close we don't I mean they've always been there for me and I appreciate it but we've never had that closed collection connection especially since they're foreign so they don't really understand where I'm trying to come from having been grown up out in America so it's pretty different when it comes to a racial mean the cultural boundaries that we kind of Step each other each other's feet on but aside from that we have a decent relationship when we do speak to each other it does it kind of awkward but it's okay I think they are out of control I think that they're learning things that they shouldn't know at this age I think that they're doing things they shouldn't be doing and I don't feel like enough people are telling them that they shouldn't be doing it I feel like they're being applauded by the media there being applauded by celebrities that they follow and there's not enough being done about it and they're just getting lost how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep depends on the night some nights it's pretty hard some nights I fall asleep like a baby what are you like when you don't say usually creative actually when I can't sleep I'll just stay up and I'll write something or read a book and ideas will pop up stuff like that is usually a good thing when I can't sleeps nothing really bad cuz I'm having bad thoughts or anything like that I'm lately between a mix of good and bad I have my happy moments where I'm at a Giants and I'm alive and then some some days where I'm just you know just sitting there just mellow thinking not like my life self I don't know his wife's been like that weighs have those UPS in those downs but they kind of balance each other out no the last time I felt really happy was today I'm just from the moment I woke up it was a beautiful sunny day I went to see you some friends we

that I shouldn't have done all at one time how I've hurt people have hurt her the ways I've done them that were brutal and it just made me feel bad once I reflected on it all my parents can you tell me about I mean although we don't see eye-to-eye the always bring me to this realization that I need at the end of the day although I never listen to him or I don't choose to listen to him once it happens I learned from it and I'm like oh that's what my parents told me so I learned to trust them more and I learn to understand that they are wiser than me and that they do no more than me I'm not

possibilities I discovered I like I enjoy discovering new people new cultures new things that go against what's normal for us and for myself a few days ago I just drove out to the middle of the desert and I just sat there and I just enjoyed all that the desert has to offer and it was just enjoyable I felt free away from all this the city's needs buildings and it just felt nice to be out in the

the people and the unhealthy pace I would see I did like culinary and I did really good in art and music in high school through my own will and desire to want to get involved with the music no open up a health practice of some sort what made you decide to do that changing things in my life that had an impact on myself and others for the for the benefit of Health I'm sure you can tell by my shoes do you travel when I have the opportunity buying things seeing the culture relaxing not thinking about the city well yeah I used to go to Texas every every year with my dad during the summer and I always wanted to stay there and live there when I went on vacation most likely one of these trips to Texas where we would go and spend time in the desert shoot guns and ride go-karts and stuff like that it was I'll see y my dad and I are not really talking that much and my mom Dust Away about 2 months ago I'm sorry to hear that thanks definitely Marsh I always been that way I just a personality that I've grown into but learning how to adjust the sensitivity and grow out of it sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got teen eating I like to eat that make that calms me down not that good when I get really upset that it's usually a problem and I have to work to come myself down and sometimes I just don't get on something and I don't stop sometimes but I've learned to control it to that extent now when was the last time you yesterday I was arguing about what's what kind of water we should be drinking oh well a difference of opinion and I felt as though my opinion was very valid even though the other party's opinion was somewhat misinformed definitely everyday is growing process I wish I would have handled everything differently every day which is what makes me grow and I tried to work toward, it would have wanted to handle things everyday little by little okay tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to can't think of anyone right now what's something you feel guilty about find I'd I'd say not supporting my friends as much with their career choices I'd rather not get into it the raw food Educators on YouTube and raw vegan Educators and the detox therapy therapy experts have been really inspirational in the past 2 months well that they believed that the essence of all nutrition comes from the raw fruits and vegetables and this is true with many studies like T Colin Campbell The China Study the sources of information that are that are very good and I think deserve respect based on you know real research how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep really easy I've almost got it down to a science what are you like when you don't say I'm tired I'm feeling better than I have in a long time oh yeah I think it's due to the transition in the diet and in no way having a placebo effect that's actually you know losing them talks and some things that I've accumulated over my short lifetime of you know toxic choices with Food and Drugs or whatever it would be yes I'm less tense and less irritable and I have more clarity and more control over my decisions in my wants versus what I need that sort of thing nope yes to some extent our 5 years ago lack of motivation and basically make my symptoms were paralleling that of depression loss of appetite loss of motivation not wanting to do anything not wanting to be social at all having fear of social situations and the main for 5 no I believe I overcome to chapter in my life that was the the doctor you know taking control my health and experimenting with drugs and I just sort of took another route which was alternative and I started juicing more and just trying to listen to maybe what I needed with help of the internet and nutrition experts and stuff like that yes can you tell me if I believe therapy is useful because without looking inward or having somebody to help you to that it's very hard to readjust to some of these problems that you can have that will just resume in the subconscious and tell you you know it has an outburst is basically therapy will help an overall health and mental health I believe fairy last night I made a really great vegan dinner with no meat tacos and cheese and guacamole and had a couple of my friends over and they really liked it a lot of almost converted them I would say you know I'm trying to listen to my inner conscious more than what my brain wants me to do like my brain likes caffeine and sugar or as you know my body needs something other than that apple it's very very hard it's a daily process tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad I was handling money for a business partner and they ended up short and I was to blame but it was actually my formula crunching the numbers that it made it short but they he was unaware of the change I make the formula so the blame is on me that I may have took money and I automatically felt bad about that because of my uneasy my uncertainty to the change of formula is there anything you regret no 20 years ago I was two years old 10 years ago is 12 years old I would tell myself to to start eating raw fruits and vegetables everyday as calm and sad maybe smart talented I really enjoyed going to the Wholesale Food Market in downtown Los Angeles can you tell me about that lots of food at great prices you can eat and feed a whole family for a third of the price is going to a normal supermarket so I really get a lot of enjoyment of teaching people how to maybe better themselves especially food-wise what they're eating what are some things that usually put eating and I'm watching a really good TV show okay I'm insightful I cannot I can adjust to people I don't know I guess I'll skip that question for now I'm most proud of that's in my overall situation with where I'm at right now I could have never imagined that I'd be in such a fortunate situation that's so good to hear because I want

then I laugh once twice a year compared to a cold very cold because I wanted to pursue my acting career how did you do well it wasn't a hard decision it was just it was the weather it was the opportunity it was the options more options the driving has been a pain in the butt not so easy blesse besides the weather I like that things are more convenient I like some of the people here that are actually from home but yeah and I just I like I like that it's a little late back that's about it I don't like the traffic I don't like the gang violence in certain areas and I don't like I like maybe that's that's all I don't like I don't know you know I like I don't like that it's so far away from home I wish I wish La was kind of Midwest I wish it wasn't so far from home have a close relationship with my family it's a small immediate family is really small and we're closed my grandmother recently passed saw it some and adjustment right now but I'm close to my family okay I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot well I can't see your shoes but I do travel often I do travel yes I'm getting there I like getting beer once I'm at the wherever I'm going I like to actually do the tourist thing get to know places and people okay I will owe I went to I'm France few years ago well many years ago and a little town called Carcassonne and was very it was it was actually really fun but very much like a storybook as far as what I expected to seeing what I actually saw like what I remember that I really enjoyed was that at night when everybody closes up like there no windows in the buildings but they are the shutters that most places in the United States have inside of Windows they have them outside of the window there's no glass so you just shut and it looks like everything is abandoned like the buildings are abandoned so pretty cool I like that I'm borderline sometimes I'm shy sometimes I'm outgoing and depends on who and what the situation is music I turn on music I walk through the neighborhoods now I'm pretty good at controlling my temper I'm not a hothead at all oh it was annexed roommate and it was about my loyalty as a friend can you tell me about the yeah pretty much gif I thought that because I wanted my rent what she agreed to pay that I was not being a good friend that I should just let her live for free that wasn't going to happen so you know the Loyalty came with letting you stay anyway or letting her stay anyway even after she didn't pay me so that's a friend I could have kicked her out I didn't she laughed at the agreed time after she let me know that she was not going to pay but she could have could have been a bad situation but there was an argument there a real a real one I wish I had handled that situation differently and follow my first mind when we agreed to be roommates temporarily and gotten my money up front that's what I wish I had done and I just I didn't my mind told me to go along with it no my my told me to get the money up front but I didn't so the hardest decision I think I have yet to make the hardest decision but so far like maybe leaving home leaving home when I was years ago when I was like 18 yeah I felt like I was abandoning my family that's what I felt but I'm very encouraged me to go on and live my life something that I could erase from my memory probably a friend who I was on dating I would like to erase from my memory how he responded to me when I told him my grandmother was ill how is your day I'm it's easy if I'm busy all day and I'm really really tired but actually my mind spins so it's not that easy actually it's not that easy I have to because I have to be exhausted I have to be exhausted to be exhausted now it's not really hard you just do a lot of stuff all day long irritable up and down I've been up and down like sometimes I've then excited and anxious and on the other side I'm like what am I doing I need triggered by something you're just a nature sister want to make some things happen some goals getting certain kind of work and having a certain amount of income and just taking care of myself do you know the way I think I should take care of myself just the physical stuff eating right and everything yeah I have can you tell me about sometimes I have a lot of distracting thoughts that have nothing to do with what I need to be focused on in the moment and I'm conscious of that him like of all the things that keep popping up in my head why am I thinking about that I let them happen and then I try to think about other things and FaZe it out pops back up I phase it out I know now when the roommate moved out I was really happy when she finally left tell me how you spend your ideal weekend I'm probably reading and maybe go I'll go dancing that would be ideal I can go dancing salsa dancing and yeah what are some things you wish you could change about your my ability to make a decision quicker and to act on it really badly I don't know if I have a time to someone has ever made me feel really badly I don't feel bad about much as courageous I will be at in a nutshell in general I regret not making some different decisions when I was younger as far as moving forward as far as career stuff and relationship things I wish I had done some things earlier in my life that I'm doing now I'm really going after some of my personal goals and deciding to actually be in a relationship that's long-term and yeah I wish I had done that earlier 20 years ago I would have given given myself the advice to continue with my schooling beyond what I did and to be more Discerning in my choices of individuals who I allow in my life being a part of the family that I'm a part of thank you goodbye I didn't know

later okay okay so what do I do just do what she says okay and you said if I don't want to answer I can just I don't want to answer the wild okay cool thank you okay are you okay with that yes so how are you doing today okay Atlanta Georgia in 2006 never I don't like it there it's completely boring and there's very little to do la is preferable I think to most places because I was engaged to my fiance and we lived in Florida I moved there to be with him and he loves the water but I love the mountains I missed hiking and I love Florida and he wasn't tied to it so we decided we wanted to go somewhere where we can both be happy and also have more opportunities in business and all of the great things that I have to offer very easy there's not much I don't like about la I love La I think it feels magical so many creative different people of all ages shapes sizes colors races the mountains of water the city all the things that there are to do all of the different people there are to meet I just I love everything about la no I'd rather not talk about it I didn't go to college I'm still figuring that out I don't know it may may have something to do with animals I have a dog that I really loved and I never had a dog as an adult I had cats and I think I'm a late bloomer so I'm working on that whole conversation I don't I really don't want a job I want a purposeful way to create wealth not just something to make money in the long run it depends on the situation but in general I consider myself more Scheib although most people would consider me to be outgoing sometimes when I'm feeling I turn on the fish tank screensaver what do you do put on classical music music classical music especially stressed and play with my dog go for a walk I think I'm really good at controlling my temper for the most part before I came here it was just about them Financial stress there's probably a lot of examples I think I'd rather move to another question yeah I'd rather not talk about that either I'd rather not talk about that how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep not very easy at all I'm a lot better recently but I have a history of chronic insomnia and some health problems so it's challenging not to feel rested most of the time in the past week I've been feeling a lot better tell me about that yes I the weather has changed spring has sprung it's a little warmer as having more trouble with my depression in the winter and having trouble with tolerating cold and so I wasn't doing a lot of the things that I normally do and I also was sick with the flu and in the past week I decided that I was feeling better enough that I needed to kind of get out of my rut and start getting more focused around things that I need to do during the day and walking my dog everyday and not isolating so much sing some of my friends more so I was feeling I've been feeling a lot better like I've been making progress and that in the past week things have taken a more positive turn no yes it's been quite some time of officially it's probably been I don't know exactly but let's see maybe more than 15 years ago I was feeling suicidal no because I found a better alternative I've been there be off and on since I was 18 and I'm tried a variety of methods and then I started working with some neuro-linguistic programming her and that was really the first person that helped me make permanent changes and I was able to get off my antidepressants as well and even though I struggle with some bouts of depression it's never been anything extremely severe and I was one of the best things that ever happened well I was physically ill with chronic fatigue syndrome and I had a client that referred me to this person because he had cured her of that disease and that was he treats multiple issues and so everything is interrelated so once I had my first conversation with him I knew it was the right step for me I'm so happy I felt like I was some I felt that I found the answer that I've been looking for that I hadn't given up hope panda I would like I'm glad 9 that I had been suffering for a long time and I felt that I finally found the answer to the solution that I was looking for I was like every last thing I ever did in my life or the best decision I ever made extremely helpful for the first time in a long time I went to I went to a music store because I've been thinking about I'm taking up an instrument I used to play the violin as a child and I've been wanting to do something that would give me more access to my creative side because I felt it's been extremely depressed and numb that's how I went to the music store to try out to see what it would feel like to to handle and the instrument again and see if I thought that that was something that I would want to pursue it was awesome yeah I'd rather not talk about that well that's probably a lot but I'm always working on being more optimistic it's been challenging it takes time but I wish I could hear my own internal voice better yeah I have regrets sure value myself more so that I would make better relationship decisions my fiance is the most positive person in my life my My ultimate supporter tell me about I think very unique not the not at all selfish and the probably a little too giving for his butt always has my best interest at heart has the highest morals of anyone I know would give somebody the shirt off of his back is a genius and so many ways and I'm pretty lucky I think that I'm not a quitter that despite some very stressful circumstances over long periods of time I haven't given up on taking risks and with very gradually rising, very trembling, very low, very small pitched voice",1

they're spending so I'm good at resume resolving like consumer complex and stuff on the job I had a drunk friend that was just falling around and yelling and saying rude things to people and I kind of started getting loud like just telling her to stop doing that I didn't know that she was embarrassing and what she was saying to people was very mean and you know and I wonder like if you're talking to people like that they might not like it and they could attack you or something you know you never know it is LA what's something you feel guilty about I really don't feel guilty about anyting decisions I've made in my life I think I've made really good decisions and I always stick with my moral compass what I'm doing I grew up in church so I haven't gone in years but I still have those values and you know the rules the Ten Commandments and stuff in my head I had a slumlord landlord and I wish that I called you know the proper authorities and follow through on a court case instead of

early and going back home I decided to move there and I had just started you know this business is doing event planning was picking up and I decided to leave there and try to do it there and you know on the east coast and it didn't work out but it was tough deciding like should I leave LA and make this jump and try something new and experienced something new or stay and what I was doing I was I had a degree in Dental Assisting I did that for like a year I didn't like it and then I was sending Communications like radio and television broadcasting and journalism I'm somewhere I'm doing a van work and I wrote for a magazine a couple years and I'm trying to like get a website going and then have like where I'm controlling my own riding and what's going on instead of writing for someone else

Scotland and France all in you know one trip so that was a nice variety I guess you could say probably skiing in val de saire France that was fun I'm glad I got to do that that's great do you consider yourself more shy I'm kind of shy by Nature I've tried to grow out of being shy so I'm not fully shy but I was always an extremely shy child but now here in Culver City this is my environment and I I guess you could say I'm not really shy and in my hometown of Culver City I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got to relax I like to just curl up in my bed and read my book take a nap watch TV sometimes on the couch in the living room just you know stay at home and kind of vegetate pretty good yeah my tempers pretty level probably with my husband and I can't remember the moment what it was about okay tell me about your relationship with you well when you say my family do you mean my family from childhood or my current family okay well I guess my current family comes to mind I have two daughters and my relationships pretty good it's okay with them but they're teenagers which you know going they're going through a lot of hormones and they can be kind of bitchy and and but I have hope that you know they'll grow out of bed and soon someday we'll have a really good relationship and then there's the husband which like I guess I could face soon-to-be-ex-husband hopefully soon we need to get a divorce but we're still together due to financial reasons and yeah yeah so that that's not good relationship with the husband but but since we have determined that we need to divorce we don't expect anything out of each other so we don't argue as much so that's good well I guess our marriage I wish I had noticed early on that you know it was like way off from what I thought it was how do you say oh my God hardest decision I guess leaving my first husband that was pretty hard well you know we were married and I wasn't content I guess you could say and I kind of just gave up on our relationship and now that I look back I think it's because I want children and he would have been happy to never have any and so since I didn't have a father it was very important that I create children with someone who really wanted to be a father and so I was kind of at an age where I needed to start thinking about having children yet I was with someone who really was not into it so that I think that's one maybe the core reason why I was not content and I just felt like this marriage isn't going to work n so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not want to break up and and I had to leave him because I just wasn't happy and that was that was very hard cuz yeah felt like I was hurting him which which I was him he survived he got over and now he's married with two kids but it was hard to leave him tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from your memory something I wish I could erase from my memory have to think about that I'm sure there's something well yeah there's some I guess it'd be nice to erase from my memory a recent I'm not resend but an event in my recent adulthood here in Culver City where one of my best friends betrayed me by back years ago when my husband first got into real estate she and her family were growing and they really need a larger home and we just assumed that you know that they would use my husband as their agent supposed to sell their current home current at the time and purchase a new home and as it turned out they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent and yeah that was devastating I don't think I've ever been betrayed like that so I wish I could erase that not cuz now you know this was back when the kids were really young and my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was let's say 6 Maybe maybe five anyway her and my best friend's daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other we were pregnant together and they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we run into them in the neighborhood are they run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were just you know like two peas in a pod even those her their moms weren't talking to each other anymore so now they're 13 and 14 and they're in middle school together and they're still very connected in fact she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl and it's just a little awkward you know cuz now these girls are becoming really good friends your friends and yet I still have this bad memory of what her her mom did to to me that was about 1:10 about 8 years ago I tried it I try to ignore it and put it out of my head which have been able to in recent years but obviously it still comes up anyway that was that not that easy I do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time I wake up and can't get back to sleep but or I finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up you know that that difficult thing well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom and then you know it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then I wake up again to go to the bathroom so I guess that's the trigger as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there I don't know I think there's just too much on my mind running through my mind and the day I feel like I haven't accomplished enough during the day so it's hard for me to just go to sleep when I'm supposed to guess well I'm kind of used to it now so I just go on to the day probably looking looking tired and like I'm kind of used to feeling tired I just do what I need to do and sometimes if I'm able to if I'm at home and don't have huge commitments yeah I might just like I said earlier just take a nap or something read my book watch TV whatever lately have I been feeling kind of down on myself down on life well I have this pending need for separation / divorce I'm worried that I made a lot of mistakes with my girls now they're teenagers you know on the verge of adulthood and so I worried that you know I did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance in their early childhood and now it's too late like I missed out on a lot of things and yeah I need a job I'm unemployed I don't know what I want to do with my life I know I want to do something and I just wish you know I never did finish college unfortunately because I was traveling and stuff so I regret that extremely and I need to get a job and be able to take care of myself cuz I need to divorce and move on with my life so now I forget what the original question was but that's the state part of the state of Mo no yes well the first time or or or recently the first time I guess was you know when I was in my early twenties I was just a little upset about constantly that was another breakup I had to make back then I was in my early twenties and I needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting cuz I you know it's hard because he didn't want to break up and I feel like I was hurting him and I didn't understand this feeling I was really upset how did that was my first time having depression so I didn't really recognize it as depression but I went somehow I had the knowledge or the I was able to take myself to a psychiatrist I remember I paid for her by the hour and she prescribed Xanax to just help relax me and so I guess that helped me get through that and then I've had depression throughout the years just so you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as I guess it's usually a relationship you know yeah so the most recent time I was diagnosed and put on meds that was probably about 2 years ago no money and I don't have insurance otherwise yeah I'd be happy to go to therapy anything that might help tell me about the last time you felt really happy last time I felt really happy I don't know I guess maybe when my children were born I guess happy I just you know I always wanted children so it's nice to have them that's I don't know that's all I can remember of that and I guess I don't remember the good times too well I remember the bad times something you did recently that you really enjoy something I did that I really enjoyed well that's the way I am Friday night I went to a friend's house and met up with five other girlfriends and we we created vision boards and talked and had dinner at one of their house that was that was fun we get to stay in college get my degree get therapy trying to become happy yeah try to figure out things earlier in life like yeah stay in college and and mainly I think the mean and what it all boils down to no matter what your depressed about it seems like as soon as the saying goes in the songs go you know it's all about money the world revolves around money in having none that in itself is for depressing so besides relationships and different things that have happened in your life having no money as you know it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it so with that in mind I would definitely advise myself to get my college degree and to get a job and stick with it don't quit to go traveling and I'll just stick with a job sick with a company build up your seniority keep your benefits and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of filled yeah that would have been my biggest piece of advice to myself not much I guess just my daughter's you know there are two beautiful daughters and I'm proud and glad that I was able to have children some people aren't even able to do that you know and they try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so that's the one thing I mean I wanted five children and I always wanted a boy which I never had but I guess that's the biggest thing I can think of to be proud of having my two daughters I'm a very loyal friend and person that's why when that friend betrayed me I was so devastating yeah very loyal very happy was I going to say I was going to say happy go lucky I don't know where that came from very I meant to say friendly and caring and yeah I care about people and I'm interested in people and I care about animals as well actually that's another thing I'm proud of proud of being a vegetarian yeah so my daughters and being vegetarian and I'm a vegetarian because I really care about feelings of other beings not only humans but animals to in you know I don't think that animals should be tortured and live a torturous life just so we can eat them so what was the question remember the question okay you're welcome by I did need the tissue one time so that's good the other sister with very gradually rising, trembling, very low, very small pitched voice",1
20,406,"okay hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today creative are you okay with this yes I'm doing good I'm originally from Southern California I like the downtown Theater District I like the beaches I I like the variety of stuff that you can do in one day well sometimes I don't like the traffic I don't think there's really too much I don't like about La I really like it like that oh no I haven't really travel in about 5 years oh I just haven't been able to travel I just haven't travel I like going to new places and seeing things I haven't seen before and if I can like visiting places like landmarks I want to hear that one of your trips well the last one I did was San Francisco that wasn't so far but I got to stay in downtown San Francisco and I got to go shopping and I got to get on him the streetcar so that was cool well I still study I'm studying psychology well I decided to go back to school just pretty quickly so I went to Junior College and then when it got close to graduate I knew I want to transfer so I taking a couple psychology course is not decided I liked it so I just decide to make that my major and I thought I didn't have a lot of math but it had enough math are you happy well now that I'm almost done I don't know if I'm going to continue in that area dream job well would I wanted initially was to get in the sport psychology but I'm not quite sure that's what I want either okay you consider yourself more shy or outgoing well I have to be shy initially but once you get to know me I'm outgoing what I'm feeling I turn on the fish tank screensaver I think I either go to sleep eat something really really good or watch something on Netflix like what what does a good movie I like four movies a lot so a lot of right now I'm into martial arts movie with subtitles so I think I'm pretty good when was the you know I know they're not really long arguments I don't know if there were arguments I know I argue with my boyfriend and he hung up for my face so I don't know why and it got soft pretty quickly so I don't know if it was really that important when I walked out without saying okay I can't think of one right now I think the hardest decision I probably had to make was moving from will back to California from Oregon can you tell me about that but I was really young so I was 19/20 and I was really by myself so that was pretty hard cuz I obviously had to support myself what made you decide to do that because it was a really really boring in Oregon so I really like the activity here in LA what's something you feel guilty about you know I don't really feel guilty about many things okay tell me about your relationship with your family well I don't talk to them that much my dad and my stepmom live in Oregon so I probably talked to on the phone at least once or twice a month and then when I come out here I want to say at least once a year sometimes you can be twice you know occasionally more but not too often and I see them about it but I'm pretty much the only one out here my brother is also up there as well yeah what have lots of positive influences I think I'm just regular people are come across you know maybe someone off work with maybe I'll actually my uncle he's a really good positive but he knows quite a bit has lots of good advice like what about life you know I don't really think I've had anything that bad happen to me where I just don't what bothers me so much I have to not think about it well I can't say pretty easy cuz I work schedule and then I go to school but I want to go to sleep I sleep really well those long as I have enough you know hours feeling lately really really happy and good nope no always happy hour yesterday I'm just happy anytime I talk to my boyfriend or if I go out and do something I'm just happy I got off work I'm happy cuz I'm done for the day I'm just really happy I'm on spring break I'm really happy right now so awesome something you did read oh I haven't done like any really extremely fun activities unless you consider going out to eat but the last activity that I had a lot of fun doing with ice skating in December 10th in downtown LA is there anything you regret know I don't really have too many regrets I mean whatever happens happens and you know was meant to play out that way advice cuz you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago well I guess I would say don't worry too much about the small things even though they seem really big it really they really are insignificant and you won't think about it in 6 months from now okay I think my best qualities are I'm a happy person I'm a fun person I'm pretty easy to get along with I think most people like me and I'm just a cool person well I wish I could study more I wish I would study more I wish that I would exercise more and I wish that I think that's it right there tell me about I don't think I want to talk about that okay what are you most proud of in your life I don't know I guess I'm just taking care of myself supporting myself not having to go back home I guess that's about the best accomplishment there is thank you bye okay is that you and the other end all right so you can move back over to that computer will have you do a quick phone service with very gradually rising, very trembling, very low, very small pitched voice",0
21,407,"oh so she's like going to be counselor kind of and then I just press that and then we just have that again and they're done cool haikal are you okay yes I'm actually I feel pretty good cuz I I I slept all day yesterday almost I'm usually doing something if not work it's cool if it's not school it's work and then social life and all that so I actually didn't have work yesterday and I don't have school on have school on the weekdays so I actually slept probably like 85% of the days I actually feel kind of good but I'm actually kind of tired as well I have other stuff going on but other than that I'm good today okay I'm originally from Bakersfield California really I'm so late when I was an infant and I'm left here when I was around 3 or 4 and I've been moved I moved back here in 07 and I've been living here ever since well since I've been here since 07 I've only been back maybe maybe like couple why were there at 4 like a summer like in 08 I think I was there for like almost all summer but I don't even back up a couple times and since I've been back here unfortunately it compared to La doesn't really compare. I grew up in Sacramento actually I didn't get to tell you I was born in Bakersfield and I lived here anyways I don't know if I did I forgot anyways yeah there's like nothing really to do there it's really small as to Valley La has all the stuff to do has oceans and his file kinds of located on by a lot of cool places like Vegas and San Diego and what have you not but yeah other than that I miss my friends and stuff that I don't miss like actual City I just missed some of the people that I grew up with I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I can't see your shoes but I don't travel after I've only been out of California like six time so I would like to travel inside have enough money to do so I want to be a filmmaker and which I still want to be a filmmaker and I said I was 10 I took Communications and the general that stuff too and took my video production classes and did a lot of stuff in regards to I'm filmmaking and I have learned a lot of stuff and I still have that knowledge however I haven't really used it since I've been back here in La I did all that stuff in Northern California in Sacramento but and then I transfer switch over to be at the business which I took some classes in that but now I'm actually studying to be an optician and I'm actually almost done with schooling and getting ready to try to get infield and become an optician so but I do want to be I still want to be a filmmaker and I'm that still one of my plans and I still actually I got into I'm playing poker 2 years ago and I really like the idea of becoming a full-time filmmaker or full-time poker player have it both of those jobs are extremely difficult to make a living out of it have to be like a small percent so we'll see if not then hopefully my optician career could take me somewhere 3 oxygen I guess I was just trying to find something that it was like it it's like a trade it supposed to private college but it just like specifically trained you into one feel then you just learned that you don't do like your GED and all these other classes like you normally do for like like a major or whatever you're going to do so it just trains you to civically to be auditioning and jump in the field I took it just because I actually want to be a dental assistant sound like something maybe I could do it sounds interesting but then the counselor actually got my attention to be optician so I'm now trying to be an optician and it's interesting so it's fine it's really hard but it's interesting in it and it and it's it's fine we want to benefit this far as like being able to help people see better and feel comfortable with glasses or contact lenses whatever they feel welcome for what I'm definitely outgoing however I can be shy sometimes like I'm kind of shy right now because talking to you and your computer and your cartoon or animated or whatever but no usually 98% I turn on the hey but it's the best I've got I actually was actually kind of funny and I think maybe this might go further some of the poker players to really I've never really talked to any professional poker player to be as far as like I actually playing poker is actually something that helps me forget about anything as far as like stuff in the past or present or future stuff is coming up as far as like I am really would I really do not think about anything and just think about poker and it actually it's kind of like a therapy thing for me cuz I don't like I guess you could say the kind of drug because I don't think about anything as far as like stressed out or depressed our stuff that's happened in the past I just like focus on poker so it's actually kind of relieved and however playing poker is very stressful on top of that so I guess it's kind of like a catch-22 or whatever but yeah so no poker I put like to play basketball I like to watch movies I can go to the beach actually one of the things I like to do is go to the beach cuz it does it makes me feel good but I usually when you go to the beach when it's hot. During the cold season so it's coming up soon so looking forward to that I'm really busy but I'll try to go to the beach because I can't I'm really good at controlling my temper actually I've only been in like I'm 30 years old I've been in like six fights maybe and all six of them were started by the other person so I've never started a real fight in my whole life like I started fighting a little kid but talking about like a real stuff like what you get past like 13-14 but yeah I know I'm good like every now and then like there's been in the past were like I wasn't able to control it but as far as I ever being violent or anyting that's never occurred and never would but for the majority of the time yeah I don't have like people do stupid things all the time and I just like Let It Go expect to like I'm on the freeway and stuff but oh I mean I get about with my ex girlfriend a lot but it was just about really Petty things I guess that maybe we just I think we were good for each other but maybe some other lifetime because we just bumped head too much so obviously she's my ex-girlfriend probably for a reason so we just argued about girlfriend boyfriend thing I guess my film there's a lot of stuff I got to handle differently about maybe like when I was doing really good when I was younger and I was working for production assistant for a filmmaker's around where I live in Sacramento so I was doing everything that I want to do as far as my dreams are concerned and had a lot on my stuff together I have my own car mode apartment and then I got involved with like the wrong group of people I guess and kind of tumble down hill from there in like lost everything like our apartment so I just wish that maybe I never got involved with those kind of people that kind of girl ever because I would probably a pirate my life probably a lot different now however I believe that everything happens for a reason and obviously I think you should also like stuff that happens good or bad learn from your mistakes so that when it happens again you could not make that mistake our try not to make it as bad yes so you know I guess hardest decision the hardest decision I have ever had the maid would be I guess you could say I don't really know can I say that I maybe like my ex-girlfriend like I couldn't like stayed with her and I really like it still am in love with her and would like to be with her and miss her but I guess the biggest decision that I had to make was like I know that wasn't like a healthy relationship and I know if we like stay together if we got married or have kids that I don't think would end up working out anyways so I guess the decision the hardest decision would be till like actually stay away from her and not get back with her and not with her so I guess that was a hard really hard decision because I could easily have done it and I guess maybe I would have been happier that way but stressed out and irritable or whatever and other way of having to deal with her iguess deal with each other our relationship so it's really hard still is so I guess that's not choosing to be with someone that I loved and loved me or whatever so what was that I beg your pardon navad I understand the first part of that question oh an event own event okay that can erase event that I can erase for my memory IMAX girlfriend I wish I never met her my first girlfriend in my last girlfriend I wish I never met them cuz we were we were together and love for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard so I guess both of them how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep extremely I could fall asleep anywhere I actually the other day I broke a record I almost fell asleep standing up which would have been weird because I guess I would have fallen down or something I don't know I just caught myself I guess I was I mean I was really tired but I do a lot of stuff so it's hard for I don't really get that much sleep as much as I would like but I can sleep when I'm dead or whatever have they said I know no lately I'm just tired but I'm all right I guess I'm dealing with this breakup still it's only been like a month and a week but it's actually is not I mean I've had worse things happen I mean worst things happening had worse things happen to us well-known religious person that I'm Catholic I believe in God I know there's a God so obviously even though all of it even devoted people to God regardless of what they are they sometimes stay so I do stay sometimes but definitely last for that long and I know that there is a God and I know that I'll be okay and everything will be okay but you know it's hard to deal with them like I don't really I just keep going and I go to school and work and I just have to keep going I can't give up so I just try to stay busy and staying busy helps kind of been like sleeping a lot house but I don't go to sleep a lot so I don't know playing poker playing basketball helps me deal with him hanging out with my friend sometime I felt really happy on Friday because I went to San Diego for the first time and I didn't it wasn't as cool as I thought it would be but we're like under circumstances as far as like my friend had business to take care of and it took a long time so I would much rather been free during that time but I wasn't but we had fun it was cool I enjoyed it so yeah I really like that I was at fun and I was happy about going to San Diego for the first time and I am had a good time a lot of things but I guess I would say like be nicer to like family members know a couple family members that I wish I would have been different to at the different to not that I was like a horrible but I could have been nicer in some instances that if I didn't know the situation at hand and I would have never like really went out and partied all the time like I did like Highschool different part times of a type I would have just really focused on schooling and stuff them in to the party later would have gotten relationships that I'm sorry I just told myself more basely to be more have more Direction be more focused I guess I stay away from people and unhealthy relationships and healthy people I guess not that I'm the healthiest but yeah I just want it done a lot of stuff different but I don't know if she said earlier but I believe everything happens for a reason so I guess everything is happening now for reason something to keep going I guess there's a few that I do have a few that I used to have cuz I have best friends now couple I guess one new one and I've lost a few best friends as far as like just not we like 100 ways but I guess they're all probably describe me more as like energetic funny crazy loud silly smart and I just I guess in general just like entertaining to be around I have I haven't always been the best bestest best friend but I tried you know my hardest so that's cool change myself I wish I was I wish I was like 15 pounds lighter I wish I didn't need how do I set potatoes I feel like I feel like I'm I feel like I need to be like in a relationship with a girl but I feel like I wish I didn't have to be like feel like that I needed to have a girl all the time and so I get that, like focus more and I wish that like I didn't need sexual I wasn't always think about sexual stuff towards girls all the time as far as like me having to be in a sexual thing with them like as far as like wanting sex as much as I do cuz I feel like if I didn't concentrate our have to like be with girls are in a relationship to like well I don't know how to say it but I was saying like there's a guy friends that I know that don't need sex as much as I do and I feel like I need it more than I feel like sometimes that I wish I didn't need as much so maybe I guess I'm addicted to it a little bit more like I can focus on more things other than just I mean I don't just focus on sex but I just feel like if I focused on it if I didn't want it need it or think I need it as much that I could get step dad in my life but that sometimes I'm working on that what am I most proud of I'm most proud of almost I guess I guess I'm most proud of working for television station back in Sacramento and working on a lot of them film sets cuz like I I was 16 and I decided I want to be a filmmaker and then two years later or year-and-a-half later you basically I got I started making steps to become a filmmaker and then I ended up working in the business and working as a filmmaker for a really really really good I'm cinematographer I really good I'm freelancing to Target for those that lives in Sacramento that deal I think so I'm proud that I had a dream and I went for it and I actually ended up doing stuff to go toward my dream that were in my dream so I guess that's one of my biggest accomplishment which was like over 10 years ago but I know hopefully something like that could happen again soon or no perfect goodbye cool

meditation especially a practice that it becomes very natural so my bed is able to since when I'm not feeling at ease and I naturally breathe and start my meditation process how hot is it it could be hard if you don't practice it everyday or if you're not able to quiet your mind however if you meditate for a long time it becomes a practice like going to the trim or drinking any water you can

it's not real so I think one of the main things about having a job is enjoying those challenges living your life very proud of myself my accomplishments and I'm also very proud of my family and my friends and how they have achieved and overcome their obstacles I'm sure I have a friend of mine who is now a New York State University she had a quite some challenges trying to get there and funding our location and now she is and not only in the school but she has has acquired some funding for Education through a lot of writing letters and petitions and thing she did in order to conquer her dream to be in school so very proud of her thank you goodbye that was cool with very gradually rising, very trembling, very low, very loud pitched voice",0

My head well well don't say anything on the way back and made some bad and bad Investments back about 10 years ago how's more Charlie like what I'm looking for more trusting of people like that people in like them I thought were expert in their field and I inherited some money I was little bit careless with it and I just kind of had a Vibe you know that nothing would go wrong kind of little bit of night-night tivity and unfortunately some bad financial decision is kind of put me in a bad position for the rest of my life and fortunately he got because of a medical conditions I have talking to rebounding you don't make it all up so I was saved mainly financial and investment decisions that I really regret tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to me wow that's a tough one I can't think everything about my head okay well I don't really have too much family left the only one I have is my it just me and my uncle and we could we communicate on a regular basis he look but he lives in Clearwater Florida so long we were okay but he's like it isn't he's in his eighties and I was young my my 50 so we can we do we have kind of small talk and he's kind of concerned about my well-being but it's kind of somewhat of a on a shell of a really deep and that he's got his own problems so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation other than him it's really there's not really anybody else to have I did that part makes me a little depressed cuz I don't really feel I have anybody I can really count on a really confide in it is challenging I don't know why but I do have a medical condition something that might be part of the problem and I have a little bit of BPH so I'll be out of town for the restroom and answer your question to make a long story short it is challenging to get a good night's wake up feeling a little bit tired aching but it is difficult how deep is feeling lately well I've been feeling okay I mean be kind of feeling now actually trying to address issues that I haven't taken responsibility for but I feel a bit of calmness as of late have you ever been tagged no well I just say yes. The questionnaire and I'm not positive if it was technically diagnosed with it I did take a Venus call the mmph the Minnesota multi-faceted personality something of whether this is going back about six months ago they were asking me questions about my memory but then they also got two questions about my my well being psychologically too and I think some of the answers to the advice that I see a psychologist or psychiatrist I didn't follow that up on that because the philosophical differences but I think I might have a mild case of depression well you don't like I said I'm just kind of like kind of goat along in life and I'm doing okay but you know highlights passed me by so I haven't really fulfilled my my goal was kind of like alone I'd like to have a girlfriend I don't have a girlfriend so that's kind of tell me who I feel I can get close to and I'm not really in my life right now so what is a certainty I'm having some kind of financial uncertainties so overall not doing as good as I'd like to okay tell me about the last time you felt really happy that's a good one really happy let me think about that a minute well actually it wasn't that long ago actually I want you okay I know that one actually I think I'm going to answer I hope that old lady she was at a trade show it was a Anaheim with natural products Expo so it's pretty nice we we had some nice meals afterwards there's a lot of exhibitors giving out really nice samples it was an Anaheim some kind of got a chance to get away from LA and met some interesting people are they were very outgoing they're willing to like having experienced their product or service and I was around people that I work with who I got to socialize with old was pretty happy back then and it was about a month ago yeah that was best friend and I really have a best friend but I would say I don't know technically I really don't have a best friend so she heard me answer that so I can't really come with an answer to be honest I like to be conscientious and I do have flaws Mary but I think the overall unconscientious I try to be honest for the most part I'm on the major issues I might you know they would have likewise or you know I'm not perfect I'm not going to come to the serious stuff I tend to be pretty honest I'm a hard worker. Good work ethic can you be pretty calm for the most part play regret what can you elaborate on that well I just well just overall I regret them not be a little more assertive in my earlier earlier life if I put myself in this position is going to go back to my financial decisions that was sort of that sort of like my albatross in my life I made some bad decisions and unfortunately the kind of pay the price for now so I kind of like sort of like living sort of a popper existence right now which is kind of kind of depressing so I would say that's part of what I regret most of all advice would you give yourself 10 well I would say to really you don't analyze kind of go with what you really feel I think I was going with other people's opinion other people's advice I was kind of going away from my basic beingness you don't like the way I really felt like I'd make you aggressive investing which if it turned out good it would be like for like when the lot I would have been well off for the rest of my life but unfortunately it went the opposite way too many eggs in a basket so I kind of regret it going with my gut feeling and let other people influence me and I could by Nature I'm a conservative person so I should really do more conservative Investments another is my life at 10 to be more conservative but I kind of made some aggressive financial decision so that's pretty much can a local doctor that area as far as what I regret wow that's interesting I've been doing a lot of working weekends so well I do like to be profitable to do something where I can actually you don't make money that's sort of like my bread and butter time could you trade shows but I'm not doing that then I'm like maybe watch some men you know I like to go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game go to a movie go with some friends so just going to kick back but my main primary primary focus will be on earning earning money on the weekends huh that's interesting what's prerogative I would say that I live by and large all of the wholesome life I would say I never got myself into any kind of really bad bad advice you know I I love the pretty hoe salsa my wife I said I'll probably I don't really proud but as far as I stay the course as far as not going down any real deep to speak okay my pleasure that's pretty interesting is it improve your technology on a lot more like you're talking to a live person Siri it was kind of a little bit more Academy can tell us like a more like a like a video game this looks more like a real person communicates like return for not trying to deal with her but it was some other guys and I think I know what it was but it was a little bit more I can't reveal all the details but this is see no more comfortable more natural yeah with very gradually rising, very steady, very high, very small pitched voice",0

25,411,"I was just wondering if she doesn't look like anything like the actual yeah like a virtual reality thing yeah k okay k okay when I'm done okay and please are you okay with this pretty good New York I moved to LA in the 70s but I asked you what I lived a lot of different places I guess every few years but I travel a lot so I've lived in I've lived in Africa is Lyft in Spain Switzerland Hong Kong 2 what do you enjoy about different cultures food music rituals of everything the smells of colors makes you feel alive excuse me one of my trips I lived in Kenya for about a year I'd say I love horseback riding so when you're viewing other animals when you're kind of Disguise in the scent of a horseshoe can approach the animals a lot closer so it was great seeing red orange ball sunsets and riding along you know seeing somebody animals yeah in Kenya probably when I went to a messiah Village and I happen to I used to live in Hawaii and I had been to Tahiti and I was wearing one of those perils that are hand-painted and I had it tied over the left shoulder with the Twisted one or not and I happen to enter a Maasai Village for the first time that day and I looked all around in the men were wearing their clothing exactly what the same Twist on the same shoulder and they came over to me and they said why are you dressed Maasai and and then they came back and gave me what appear to be some very large what looks like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings and they would have liked Wade my ears straight down and and then gave me some bracelets and then they had me wear something around my waist in the city now you look proper Maasai so but I I just I have a lot of fun I think living getting a chance to live in different countries around the world I'm just you feel alive all your senses are completely you know I woken yeah I think it's not so clear-cut I think a lot of people's are a hybrid of both I mean I think I can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely Brazen and very courageous and other times probably one of my best virtues is I'm very gutsy person so when I really feel passionate about something I Risk Everything To Go Achieve it sometimes I believe that usually will I make decisions very quickly and I find that I have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he said to me tell me how I can make decisions quicker and I told him I said well and that you should case you always have no choice in this is what do you mean there's hundreds of choices and I said not really because it's got wise is only one and it doesn't really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy mental energy reflecting all of it when I get why she always know what the choice were you really want to do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a 98% chance of failure even if it's a 2% chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield your joy so I always go to that ass tits to me a waste of total time and energy to even think about another Choice cuz who cares if you remain unscathed but it wouldn't yield to no joy sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Departed you said you put your fish what do I do when I'm annoyed I don't want to annoy sometimes like it's because sometimes I can have like it needs to be a little more patient I guess you really have to put yourself and somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy how hard is it not really I think that's the reason why I enjoy traveling so much cuz you're putting other situations where you're forced to to understand other people's lives a lot more regardless of how different they are from your s different situations I've been to so many third world countries and lived in so many different situations that helps create that which is why travel is really the best education there is when was the last time my sink last time I argued about something go try to remember oh is he goes when somebody didn't respect actually my privacy and something oh I know what it was it was somebody who belong to the Scientology face I inherited I inherited possibly of a immune disorder from my mother my mother died from lupus and I sometimes even right now I had like skin rashes welts and everything and I am very photos sensitive and I had an you know what episode where was I had a big flare up and I wasn't really feeling well I felt flushed and everything and the scientologists tells me that I needed to be audited and and he said something about are you aware of past lives and I had told him that I was Buddhist and I was kind of curious that if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed be able to talk to them and he said that are you aware of that about something in your past and I go yes I believe that many religions including buddhism's and Scientology believe that things that you have had in your history sometimes a statue or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness resulting from even your past relationships or your parents can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and we also believe I said that you know that you had the power of each person as a god-like or Buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself even when I'm on the verge possibly and I probably get one cold maybe every 15 years I don't have a tendency to be sick at all and a large part of it as I think when I think I'm on the verge I take the sort of like and I did this even when I was a child when I was seven I would fall down I have my boo boo and I would say I would say I would have two good part you know help the bad part of a simplistic way in terms of a child and I would actually even when I was in a very severe car accident where I got cut by glass my whole back I contradict healing an enzyme when I went back to the hospital the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that she has hers last week or back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so I believe that but but I was just I think I'm annoyed and irritated because the scientologists told me that because he had taken 20 or 40 courses and he had the certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and it wasn't even matter I said of whether he was really took 20 40 courses of whether I've been practicing Buddhism whether it was for 5 10 15 20 years of weather of somebody been practicing some type of Christianity for 50 years and Benny sitting in a church pew every day doesn't mean a person could have never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has you know so I just was thinking that is the antithesis of somebody who says they were lighting but it's just the way I guess he kept grabbing his you know his face down my throat that after while I was pretty patient with a but then who it was so Papa's that I became irritated especially when he kept telling me that I was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery the following week and I didn't point it out him cuz I just didn't want to get into it but one could say hey you have a bad hip cuz you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn't need to get hip surgery I mean I believe to some extent things that can be caused by people themselves and then he flippantly said while you wear a Scientologist believe that past lives can also affect you know what I'm thinking to myself Buddhist of all religions kind of like well known for being believing in in a cause and effect and past life situations and I found my thought you should really read up if he's trying to convert other people from other religions so but you know I die you know I I I just didn't you no care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it but other than that I mean I don't sometimes to have a little more tact I guess when when in terms of patients I can think of that right away I guess disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital I'm sorry how did you do my brother was supposed to be the strong and supposedly because he is in the medical field so my sister and I said well you know he's a medical one so he's probably used to seeing this all the time but it turns out he was the weakest one and even after you know my boss my father kept me know you know bucking these body would actually be fighting the artificial respirator and what kind of things you see all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was just very hard but you know I was after while the you know even the Physicians and even the pastor from that particular you know hospital they said that he was no longer like even if he was to awaken from that he did his brain function would have been you know legible that was tell me about Nevada I don't think I really have that many things that are that traumatic that happened to me that I've had to block them I really don't know what it is within my makeup which doesn't make me feel like I need to like I don't keep the I have friends that have on mitigated issues which they're not even aware of that affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger their hatred or their fear and for some reason I feel blessed that I don't have to like I can't really even think of something that I mean I've had some bad situations happen to me but it's not that the some reason they traumatized me in effecting you know my behavior where I would wear I block at that I'm not aware of something or I hold residual negativity for some reason so I really can't think of anything I mean does bad things that happen I know that they are but it's not like I feel like a necessary for me to block them because I've been able to you know chaps that sometimes they were unfortunate things that happened pretty easy I can usually make my sleep by Self sleep in any situation if I have a 1 hour flight to San Francisco I could just kind of lean against the window where the pillow have a blanket over and even on our flight pass out before the plane is even taking off from the ground so I can I have literally when I've had little sleep and I very at high energy so I don't really need that much sleep but say like if I'm in Africa and I Bobby potholes unpaved Road and I still need side I need a few moments of sleep I was just prop something up put my elbow against the window and say I think I should take a nap for 15 minutes go like this and through the jostling I could just take a nap for 15 minutes so I don't really have that problem okay pretty okay me and I could deal without the skin flare-ups but you know from the photosensitivity and all that but other than that I'm pretty good spirits have I ever studied what I can still couldn't hear you I'm sorry have you noticed any changes in your I've ever studied changes in my behavior was the word enough I know I just with friends and everything just even this past week just seeing friends that I enjoy being with and just having great meal laughing just having a good time listening music designing your address regret about my entire life you man or are you talking about just recently or what are you talkin about you know what's funny I find that lot of the negative experiences that are in my life that have happened are falsely been opens up experiences that are that are also great that I have not overlooked root sample I got totally ripped off by my business partner to the tune of my old my whole savings ever had to start all over again and sometimes people say to me like are you sure you're okay or are you just pretending to be okay or are you angry do you want to seek revenge if I was there cuz my business partner essentially ripped me off we knew each other's families which was even more difficult in a way and he still essentially my whole life savings essentially in a way and tea what got sent to prison or the FBI was involved in her pulse involved I was living in Switzerland and my father was sick and I was going back and forth and but you know if I hadn't get involved hadn't gotten involved with him and business I wouldn't have had there a lot of Rich experiences and I think sometimes the reason why I don't know why I'm such a positive person but for some reason I'm able to this not that I'm purposely trying to I do see the positive this and even harmful situations I wouldn't have gotten to live in Barcelona and Zurich I wouldn't have learned to speak as good Spanish Drummond lived in in Europe if I had not got involved in business with my business partner end up ripping me off but and there's a lot of other experiences a different friendships that I developed during that. Of time and in a way it was a total different life a different world that that would do you know that I would have never have the chance you know to live through if I had not been filed in my ear but of course it cost me financially and but then again I've always been a type of person who your money isn't everything and I think the one I least cared about money is when I made the most of it so there you go and resemble one of my favorite times in my life probably when I lived in Kenya and you would think that you know a lot of people have this really bad Vision or maybe looking living in mud dong Huts or something and living very primitively I mean it's not like that at all that I and you think that with the least amount of technological innovations and stuff like that I mean actually and I'd really didn't have you know that much been many material Goods to the time I mean I had the blast I had probably been one of the best years of my life when I was living in Kenya that's so good to hear what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago the same thing that I did probably when I was about 15 or 16 to live your life with passion and again like shoes the way I was saying earlier about making decisions you have to make those decisions. Wise what will give you a sense of on wonderment what will make you give you Joy and you have to its regardless what the percentage are even if you only have a 1% chance of success you have to go to sad cuz that's the only thing that will yield you know the happiness in your life Otterbein your life the fact that I've a two-year to that and been Brazen whatever you want to say have the balls of cuts / like a harness to go ahead and follow my passions and you know I guess people called me somebody strong decisions usually this isn't sorry when you where you remain unscathed usually don't heal Joy that's just Murphy's Law Office just the way it is okay I think I've asked everything I need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me hi with very gradually rising, very trembling, very low, very small pitched voice",0
26,412,"hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in todayI was created to talk to people and safe are you okay yes okay originally from Texas a few weeks ago I've been living in Palm Springs actually so la there's a lot more to do and why there's a lot better for work yes the weather the beach a lot of activities things to do traffic and the rental is how higher here at first a little difficult but then I adapted I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I just in the United States new experiences learn a lot of things yeah one time I went to Yosemite and up to San Francisco I really enjoy the beautiful scenery I probably when I last year I met a girlfriend up in San Francisco and drove down Highway 1 and saw a lot of sight Hearst Castle things like that a computer science I want to school back in the 80s in the computers were kind of a new new up-and-coming things so decided to do that are you still working little bit not too much I probably I think they have like a little lamb little magazine my life story started it's like a small local magazine that has a coupons and going to expand it to different parts of California probably shy well let's say not I guess not as outgoing as many of my friends okay sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got what do you do actually I go dancing I like dancing that's relaxing to me I do Latin dancing so I do it several times a week so last week I went very good I think I've argued with someone a couple of weeks back was about a religion religious issue how did you feel felt okay say can take upon right now let's say maybe when I was doing one of my real estate sales I was sometimes the clients are pretty yet pretty difficult and I think I should have been like a little more asserted what them probably a moving to California well I was leaving my friends and family in Texas and pretty much starting a new life out in California out here I don't know it was it was pretty difficult but and I got adjusted well I have only an aunt and a few cousins left so not too much of a relationship I have a great-aunt that's the sister of my mom and send a text. Oakley but most the time I really don't have much contact with family probably parents both have been very supportive probably when the parents were sick passed away is it uncomfortable no well I like the both parents were I got sick and got dementia and you know one parent didn't remember who I was so as that part was pretty difficult wow well they they passed away so it's just been about 10 years so it's just just memories now not too easy just tossing and turning all night I think and probably thinking thinking too much about things probably like the future things like the economy and my work things like that tired how did the feeling lately tired just not as positive no no probably few weeks ago I received a pretty good Real Estate Commission so I was happy about that suspend your ideal weekend I want time in LA going to some of the meetup groups or some some of the I like going to Whole Foods and then trying some new places to go salsa dancing okay is there anything you regret probably to be more outgoing probably be more successful in business and be a little more outgoing tell me about a time when someone probably my boss said he's pretty condescending and I'm really likes to belittle people and put him put himself as the king so he leave had a lot of comments to make himself build himself up and the little whoever whoever else is in the room usually when you go in he likes to brag on how much money he's made in the business and then say things like go see was how much better I am than you are you look how much money I've made this year in and you're the worst piece of shit agent there is things like that probably have integrity and good heart hard-working honest probably I just went I guess some of the times I've gone dancing I went to a casino in a little town called Temecula I met a lot of new friends and did the dancing meeting Friends new friends probably I'll let the education I guess my education and able to move move out here where I wanted to go thank you bye computer when you're finished with very gradually rising, very trembling, low, very small pitched voice",1
27,413,"okayand please are you okay with this yes I'm doing okay I'm from Greenwich Connecticut yes I moved here in 2008 so about 5 years ago I try to go back at least once a year sometimes I go more sometimes less overall I think I like where I'm from better than La in general that other than it being somewhere I'm familiar with the type of people that are there are just more my type and what I'm used to and less superficial I understand Monument all my move got here for college after I graduated high school and my mom and sister live in California initially it was easy because I felt like it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in how different it is and what life is out here it became more difficult than originally Fine Arts in photography I was interested in photography since high school, I did a lot of programs and got Awards and things like that and publishments so I decided to pursue art yes I have a fine arts degree that I got last year and awesome are you happy you did that yeah I really enjoy working or interning in forensics I like that better than initially what I wanted to do was freelance photography I feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting Centrist in question I guess just my childhood in general growing up while my family is very close my extended family as well and they all most of them live within the area on the east coast in general so we would always do large family parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that yeah it is really fun and we try and I'll get together as much as possible which is more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries I consider myself more shy sometimes when I'm feeling hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got what do you do I watch reality television I think it's kind of funny and lighthearted like what I watch Like Bravo TV like The Real Housewives shows and like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to I'm good I guess I don't really have like a temper from having if I'm more stressed out it definitely shows in my attitude but I don't have like anger when was the last time you argue with someone will me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time just like about like insignificant things but other than that I had an argument with my dad a few days ago can you tell me about does Ben like some tension going on since I went and visited over the holidays this past winter things about his girlfriend and he thinks that I should be the one to make some kind of effort to have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways so for like the 30th time he we were on the phone and he was telling me how I need to call her and speak to her and I told him that I was going to do it over this past weekend cuz of the Jewish holidays and he kind of was just like very mature and telling me you'll forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like I could care less because I I don't care about having a relationship with her so she doesn't want to hear from me you know it's easier for me I mean every time I mean that's been the same recurring argument a lot and I wish that I could sometimes I do but I wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that I could just bite my tongue but the thing is is that he says certain things that are untrue or thinks he knows that like will take me off that are really nasty and that he shouldn't be saying to me so he so I kind of just like lose it and I can't really like not say anything well I guess the hardest decision I made which I didn't really realize that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to go after you graduate high school where you go to college because for me I've basically changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like the progression of The Next Step but looking back now that's probably one of the hardest decisions I made tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory I wish I could erase the event or seeing my grandmother's funeral which obviously it wouldn't change anything but it wasn't seeing her there was not something I'd want to like have in my memory come she was she was a very positive influence and always was not judgmental and now I mean my parents are great role models just in general I mean they're very successful people so whether or not we have like disagreements or that were separate people they kind of are good role models in terms of what you want to have when you are older usually it's easy the problem is staying asleep no matter how late I go to bed whether it's 10 p.m. or 4 a.m. I will be up like clockwork by 7:30 or 8 in the morning the latest every single day and I can't seem to figure out why I cannot stay asleep longer I need to record buy something no I just in the morning I guess I'm a lighter sleeper but I just wake up like I just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this is consistent but now it's I cannot remember the last time I slept past 8:30 in the morning I mean it just makes if I have to do stuff during the day and makes a lot more tiring but it doesn't really I'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of every day okay how you doing lately I don't know I kind of just feel very like so so just no extreme highs no extreme lows kind of one no land I mean nothing like lately like recently it's just I would say over a. Of years I kind of progressively become more seclusive and just reserved and not very outgoing no no I have been diagnosed with anxiety I had some breathing problems for a day or two and I had to go to the hospital cuz I thought it was more serious cuz I couldn't breathe but they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety I think in the right setting and with the person who's doing it if they're open-minded and the therapist is helpful and good at what they're doing then yeah no I haven't been to therapy since I was a kid I went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like deal with whatever issues they were having with me but it was never so I mean we just sat around and talked about my day wasn't it I didn't feel like I needed therapy at the time so I didn't really get much out of it tell me about I was happy when I was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the New Year's holiday when I'm there I can always just we save up our money so it's a complete vacation I don't have to worry about paying bills I don't have to worry about what I have to do tomorrow who I have to deal with I just do every morning we wake up we hang out just enjoy the day is there anything you regret in general I regret the college I chose to go to I didn't leave from the East Coast the whole Collegiate system is set up a lot differently and the university is out there or not the same as like the tight-knit California school system out here so when I was researching colleges I kind of thought that Santa Monica College was just a general College just like Boston College back home or you know any other school with the name college at the end of it I didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even that it was more like a transfer school like you you can't I didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when I went so kind of crate created more problems for me well cuz they're M22 if probably 10 years ago I would give myself the advice to probably stay closer to home and 2ave really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to California how your best friend describe you my best friend would describe me as a great charismatic funny outgoing socially enjoyable person which is different than how people who aren't my good friends would describe me which I mean I don't I mean it is what it is I I am very outgoing in and have a great time when I'm with my friend in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things I just I am very shy and don't really speak match recently my friend was visiting and we went to a Clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed that I'm very caring I am a very good judge of character which I mean I guess it's I mean I consider to be a quality for myself and various I mean never affectionate I'm more I mean I guess I guess so thanks experience I can chat with you a little bit more about with very gradually rising, very trembling, low, small pitched voice",0
28,414,"hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today created to talk to people in space and please are you okay with this yeah how are you doing today I'm okay Burbank California yeah the weather of course I think everyone likes the weather it's not too City like Chicago or New York it's a big enough we have beaches we're not landlocked sometimes the smog the traffic the fact that I've just been here like my entire life almost okay I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot not enough as I'd like to I go to school in Chicago and I've been to New York a couple times San Francisco and I took a road trip across the country that was cool I saw a couple States what do you enjoy about traveling see new places going to Landmark that I've only read about ER theme pictures of I traveled from Los Angeles to Chicago taking Route 66 and the best part was seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time it was the coolest thing I've ever seen probably happy and then Happy was as beautiful it was nice I haven't felt like that in a long time I'm studying film it's just something I've always loved for as long as I could remember and when it came time to start applying to schools I wasn't sure what I wanted to do and I apply to Northwestern as a film student and it just ended up being the right decision dream job I love making movies but part of me really loves making people laugh and being in front of the camera so comedian I'm coming a comedic actor would be totally great but you consider yourself more shy or I am super outgoing and I love talking to people a lot I like I like being the center of attention usually hey but it's the best I've got I I like to watch mindless television like Toddlers & Tiaras and Duck Dynasty just TV programs were really don't have to pay attention at all okay how are you at controlling your temper I'm okay at it I get really emotional really fast but I am usually able to use to keep my anger down and not like lash out at others and stuff for the most part sometimes I get into like arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily and I hate apologizing to people so besides could last pretty long my best friend Ryan I think and it was about our relationship and just how we kind of messed it up and cross some lines and where how we were going to go back to the way it was before how hard is that really hard it's he's my best friend and I miss him but we messed up and this is just not the same it's like not the same friendship me too too many I guess when I have a boyfriend and he has a girlfriend because not okay I wish I would have just realize that this was bad and just would have stopped there and not have let it continue 4 weeks which led to my break up and then our friendship being really messed up I guess not spend as much time with him as I did be more assertive I guess it was in November I was very depressed and suicidal so I told my friend what I was feeling and that she needed to take me to the ER and from the ER I have the choice to I don't know I guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital and even though I felt like I didn't have a choice I knew it was my choice and I decided to go to the mental hospital which is like the worst experience of my life ever it was awful it was in Chicago and it was scary and I didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just start giving you medication and you're basically left to your own devices they were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was mostly men and they were all really old and it was scary I didn't know anyone everyone most of the people there weren't depressed they were violent so that was pretty scary and I just dumb it was really hard for me I had been so depressed for like a month I stopped going to my classes and work and I told my teachers lies about being sick and I just kept calling in sick to work I dropped a class and I was failing my classes and not turned in any work and I wasn't talking to any of my friends and I was drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and I was just in a really bad place and when I finally was going to kill myself I realized I needed help it was I had severe depression when I was a younger teenager and I tried to kill myself then and I got put in therapy for quite some time so I figured I don't want to go down that bad path again I just want to get better so I had to do it I had to get help I do I go once a week I feel like if you have the right therapist it's really useful I had one therapist that I really liked and I thought we could have gone really far but sadly she's back in Chicago and I'm in Los Angeles so I have to have to make do with this new therapist and she's okay just not we're not that great together but she's who I have right now better than nothing not that easy at all ever since I got out of the hospital and start a night began medication for my depression just haven't been able to sleep well falling asleep is hard staying asleep is hired have really crazy vivid dreams that wake me up in are disturbing like what I guess just sometimes they reflect things that I'm worried about are happening in my life but they're just the scary and they seem so real that sometimes I wake up and I have to ask my mom like did we go here to be do this to this really happen and it's usually know you dreamed that sometimes I've gotten so scared I like talk in my sleep and wake myself up probably like two nights ago wow tell me about the last time you felt really happy that is a hard question I think and November after I got out of the hospital I finally had one good day and my friend took me into downtown Chicago and we went to the Sears Tower and got to look over those like big windows that you walk out on and see the city and that was with the cool how your best friend probably super outgoing likes to be the center of attention funny and a little bit crazy I try not to regret things in my life I would say that living is worth it and just don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it don't wait until it gets really bad I guess my ideal weekend would be sleeping in and then catching a movie with my friends may be going home with them and bake some cookies eat all the cookies watch some TV have a sleepover and then like make pancakes in the morning and watch more movies we watch a lot of movies I would like to do my free time go for a walk I don't know go to the beach that is a hard question I mean I think I've done a lot of great things in my life and I have achieved a lot but I think one of the proudest things badass moments in my life is something really small and insignificant I was doing this exercise boot camp and the last persons like cross the finish line had to do like 30 pushups and it was some guy I didn't really know him at all and the trainer said does anyone want to help him if he's going to help them you have to do half each and no one wanted to help him and then I just decided to start doing push ups with him and I just it wasn't cuz I wanted to get creditor because I thought it would make me look good I just did it and no one really knows about that but it's just I feel really good about that is my Buy press the button

29,415,"okayare you okay with this yes I'm good Michigan 2 years ago every 3 months it's more homey and Country Than That Face insta I work in the entertainment business so I had to be out here it was pretty easy because I live in New York first and if you can survive New York you can survive la things you really like the weather of course beaches people are much router in me than what I'm used to but I like it a graphic design media arts in High School I was ahead and all my classes and credits so I had to take a college course so while in high school I got a 2-year college degree doing it cuz

everything to seeing what the world has to offer oh okay me and my sisters went to Hawaii last year am I believe we went to Honolulu and then tomorrow we here and we met the people in Hawaii and they were so nice if I can live there I would everything was memorable but probably jet skiing in Honolulu was very fun outgoing music music is much Fairview for me well my family is very musically inclined like my dad and my mom's family so music I've always been like that thing no matter how I feel about her music on it makes it much better so good to hear I'm pretty good I used to box so it let out a lot of frustration so sometimes I do that too I go into the gym and I do like a kickboxing class but I don't I never escalated to the point where I like to learn how older now I can control it pretty much well I live with my sister so I argue everyday but it was over clothes my sisters and clothes always close my mother and my father are pastors of the church I grew up with two sisters and older brother who was the cop and we're pretty close I have a nephew we're pretty close like every day we see each other close and we don't all live in the same house but we're together every single day at some point when we lived in that when we lived in Michigan my family is in Michigan when I cheat like right now I'm on a diet with my sisters but last night I snuck and got McDonald so I feel bad because they've been so sticking to it and I cheated but that's pretty good me and mine with me and my friend of mine got into it and we said things that weren't like we hit below the belt that we and we usually don't and we haven't spoken in like 3 months now and I know that it could have been prevented if we would have just sit down and talk to each other but it didn't make it that far so yeah tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to me probably moving here moving to LA because like I'm I'm really like what we're really close to our family like I Skype with my mom and dad everyday so it was hard to go from there to here and them taking care of everything to me and my sister do it on our own it was much different oh my goodness I'm parents my brother my dad my mom my sister's my family have a great family so my family definitely 2 years ago 3 years ago my brother was shot on duty and he almost lost his life but he didn't and for some reason as much as I try I don't tell them this cuz I don't want them to be like I need to you know whatever but I always think about it over and over again and I'll cry about it like it happened yesterday but it happened three years ago just a mere fact of almost losing him Kinda Yeah how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep not easy I work as a personal assistant and administrative assistant for casting agent so I'm on call for her whenever I'm never I never get a good night sleep ever enough a zombie I'm pretty much you would never know cuz when is work unprofessional so I am tired they never know but I'm very annoyed and very grouchy when I haven't slept how have you been feeling lately tired and I have crazy headaches but that's probably from not getting enough sleep and working too much but yeah very tired yeah definitely I'm shorter with people like being in the industry I mean people don't really care if it's all about self and when I first came here I had the I had the personality and attitude of family and love and nice and being here show me that everybody's kind of out for sale fear even though the other girls I work with so I've learned to like cut people off and be short with people when that's not really me but I just see that's how you have to be have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD last Saturday I did a way in and I lost 7 pounds I was like cited how do your best friend describe you care too much I think about others more than myself so she probably said I care too much I'm loving I'm the person that every friend I have some fighting from best friends and just regular friend so yeah I'm the mom of my friends no no I don't regret anything never take no for an answer things you wish you could change about you I wish I could well I don't know personally I want

30,416,"never had that doesn't matter okay start a conversation okay go back over here when she said she'll let you know hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment and please are you okay sure I'm doing good how are you Chicago yeah about 25 years ago yeah it's been a while actually haven't been back I like Ally I like la it's a big city so it's kind of similar but the weather is not the same so got to let la for the weather family I was a child you took a little adjustment but not hard the weather can't think of anything right off the bat but I sure wouldn't want to leave so my family is here so that's another reason why I wouldn't want to leave traffic not really but I've tried to shove a little bit yeah seeing new places different people the way they live their lives my went to Monterey California earlier the middle of last year that was very nice it's a good question I'm not really sure probably I can't think of anything right off the bat which makes me think it's kind of weird but astronomy yeah it was I don't know just kind of fell into it took a course liked it and then took some more and I just went down that path no there is not much job opportunities it's kind of limited yeah it does my dream job I would like to own a restaurant a nice butt bar restaurant can you tell me about I'd like to have something a little more upscale than most places you go to released in the area that I live in most places don't seem very kind of just seem like a dive bar just kind of worn out run down so something nice something different something creative something vibrant something for you know tracks of crowd but it's probably cost Lisa I don't know if it's really possible I'm definitely more shy but I can be outgoing when I'm comfortable with people that initially I'm pretty shy good idea a lot of times I try to just lay back and you know do some deep breathing just kind of clear your mind or maybe just watch a movie listening to music is good reading a book that is just takes your mind away relax I've gotten much better at it I used to have problems with that when I was younger but I'm good I'm good with that now learned that you shouldn't react immediately to situations you should you think before you speak that type of thing when was the my ex girlfriend when we broke up about 3 months ago we're relationship just wasn't doing very well so it just kind of was going down a predictable path and we just were arguing over the same old stuff and wasn't really it wasn't a memorable argument that it was it was an argument so that's all I can think of and I haven't really seen her since so that's what it is nothing special just a typical argument between two people who drowned separate frustrated like I guess everybody kind of sees things in their own way and do you know my way in my perspective is right and I'm sure her way was right too so trying to convince somebody that you love your ideas or what you're thinking is more difficult than it is because everybody's kind of looking out for themselves oh yeah that's a good example right there with the with my girlfriend I didn't have to I could have reacted a little differently and not shown so much emotion there's been times in my life where I got into arguments with friends or something like that were you know or previous relationships where I probably shouldn't have reacted the way I did you know not that I did anything bad but just more of a you know be more mature about not you know reveal your emotions so much for that type of thing tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when I was 18 is it a long time ago I went to school in San Diego and I immediately wanted to come back so I kind of ruined our relationship and we're still friends and I wish I didn't do that what's something you feel guilty about I feel like I can contribute more to my family and my friends like I think I could do better I think I sell myself short so employment opportunities are hard to come by but if I can find a good job and be a lot more happy because I can provide for myself and others so not be so much of a burden to people around me yeah real difficult tell me about your relationship with good very good we're pretty open with each other and I see my mom and dad and my sister quite often so it's good relation I mean we get along very well could be Demi is not perfect but it's good pretty easy I'm a good sleeper I'm probably irritable or harder to do tasks it's kind of like you feel like you're being strained or something because you don't have as much energy and how did the feeling lately good relatively well spring time always makes everybody feel well have you ever been tag guns with p no not at all never really really heavy and you we all feel happy everyday at some point but really happy probably been a while if I like Super Bowl Sunday I was with all my friends were having a good time so it's been probably like a month and a half or something when I was really really happy I wish I was more I guess stuff to my goals and I wish I had better drive to succeed I don't know I usually settle for less I don't know I guess that's the calm demeanor part of me that's good and bad don't really matter I kind of live in the moment and then you kind of realize that 5-10 years ago on by and should have done something I'm just going to stick to that argument with my girlfriend three months ago she made me feel pretty bad tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory I don't know when I was when I was in high school I got into an argument with a friend and I drove my car too fast and it was an area that I didn't know and I hit a turn that I didn't know I was coming and I crashed my car so I wish I didn't do that but that's a long time ago so it's not a big deal now stupid immature my parents some of my close friends I have I have a good group of three or four friends they've been positive influences caring guy nice person good heart little little unmotivated needs to improve on certain aspects of his life to make himself better and passionate I guess passionate in a good amp I care a lot and it's the same time sometimes it gets the best of me can you give me the sometimes you feel like you know you're doing more for your friends or somebody like that you're doing more than they deserve and you're not it's not being reciprocated so that's an example yeah probably but I can't think of anything off the top of my head focus more in school because while you're young you have the ability to multitask and something you did recently I don't know really enjoyed I mean I do things everyday that I enjoy but really enjoyed I don't know I cleaned up a bunch of stuff in my room so it's nice to shed some old garbage so that that was all right but don't know if I really enjoyed that I feel content after it what are you most proud of in your life how much it's makes kind of sad I don't know I think I could do better I feel like I'm Underachievers so I don't much I don't know I'm very detail-oriented organized I like to finish tasks I care a lot and I'm very caring I have good intentions in mind I don't like the wrong people I don't like to lie because once you buy one lie leads to another so I don't like that but yeah that's that's about it cool right on have a good day hey those weird I felt like I was in therapy so take this offer with very gradually rising, very

31,417,"thank you creative I'm pleased are you okay yes I'm okay a Los Angeles I don't know kind of dirty but that's to be expected from a big city my the last class I need to go to Sociology class I'm not really sure where I'm going with school but I'm thinking about sex education how did you do I think that is a really important job I feel like because there's kind of a Stigmata guess about talking about sex at leads to like a lot of unsafe sex more than planned pregnancies so I feel like it's a very important job for the world I don't know okay I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot lack of funds it depends on the people but I'd say that generally more shy of course of people who I know well like we're closer to me I am more outgoing sometimes when I'm feeling the best of guy play with my dogs I don't know if it's a nice day I'll go for a walk if it's not a nice day then or if it's like cold out or something then maybe watch a show on TV I like or read a book or something I'd say I'm pretty good at controlling my temper I can't remember I think the last person I argue with was my boyfriend probably last week but I don't even remember what it was about you feel guilty about I don't think I really feel guilty about anything I say that I regret things but I think there's a difference between guilt and regret like I think guilt is more just like feeling bad but regret is like feeling like you should have made a different decision and I think that can help you in to make better decisions in the future where is guilt you just feel bad for no reason and it's useless I regret not doing better when I was in high school I mean not getting better grades I regret Blake getting involved with certain people in the past but I mean I'm not sure that's about it that I can think of right now you done anything to avoid yeah I mean I mean in the past yeah I could have made different decisions I mean obviously some things you know you aren't entirely in your control but I'm not going to feel I'm not going to regret things that I had no power over so I'm not sure if I would want to erase it from my memory but I wish that it didn't happen to me was a time that I was raped tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make I can't really think of any hard decisions I can't think of any okay tell me about I'm not sure I can't think of any I have a pretty good relationship with my family not I wouldn't say that I'm really close with my mother but I mean we get along well and I'm very close to my sister we're basically best friends I think that my mother has been a positive influence in my life because she was always able to provide for me and she always she didn't like mistake sometimes but I think that she was always there for me when I needed it and she just did her best to raise me so I think she was a big positive influence how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep it's been easy lately sometimes I have trouble sleeping but lately I have had no problems it depends how long I've gone without sleep I can just be anywhere from like groggy to Lake really on edge and like extremely tired I have been feeling pretty good I have like general anxiety kind of all the time but it's not as bad as it has been in the past so I'm feeling mostly pretty good I think that I've actually been feeling happier lately I want to say that I'm like really happy all the time I mostly just kind of like a neutral but I have been feeling more positive lately I'm actually not sure if I have been diagnosed with PTSD tell me about I know that I've been seeing a psychologist for like since I was 16 for depression and I think my first psychologist who I saw for a few years thought that I had PTSD but I'm not sure if she ever made a diagnosis did you think you had a problem before you found out I'm not sure I don't know yes it's helpful to talk someone and have them kind of guide you in talking about something so that you can figure things this figure out your feelings about things sort of I guess for yourself or like why it helps to talk with somebody because you can figure out why you're feeling a certain way about something I mean I think sometimes you can do that on your own but talking to somebody helps I think not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I think I would spend it mostly at home but it would be sunny out and I would go outside a little bit and and play with my dogs and I probably have my boyfriend over I eat food that I like like only through that I like like my favorite foods watch movie or TV show that I like just kind of have like a relaxing time but that's nice I would tell myself to to to do better in school because throat High School is kind of an underachiever and I ended up going to Community College like on and off because I would like to have lose interest and then not do well or as well as I could have so I would tell myself to do as well as I could in school because I feel like I am capable of a lot more than I do and I think I could easily have gone missing a scholarship if I have done well in high school so I just tell myself to do good in school and probably wore myself about one or two people that turned out to be not worth my time I think I am proud of myself for not being bitter and for wanting to live kind of bitter and yes but I guess I'm proud of myself for not being selfish and wanting to make the world a better place like cuz a lot of bad things have happened to me and I tried to instead instead of dwell on them I try to or I want to be able to make things better for other people and as much as I want to help I guess Empower people to make their lives better with very gradually rising, very trembling, very low,

And is this a good time to but yeah there's some difficult times well the difficult times I really pretty much already alluded to Matt was when one of my twins got the diagnosis of schizophrenia can and they were in temporarily and when was in foster care and one was actually in an institution because of the schizophrenia so and I lost track of the question the hardest thing about being a parent at this point this point in my life there is nothing hard about it what's the best thing about being a parent the best thing about being a parent I don't know I guess it's just to see something that you created and developed into a pretty decent human being you know a person smsa oh a lot of ways well actually I didn't have two parents I had a mother and the father was never in my father was never in the home and he lived in another state so I have no contact with him but the things that I do differently than what my mother did she was a strong disciplinarian both verbally and physically and she had the tendency to see how group has tendency to be very critical critical and opinionated and very religious and swearing for a look at people who were not that was me as if they were living life wrong because they were not going to church and reading the Bible and all that kind of thing was that the park the question I don't get a good night sleep I don't sleep at all unless I take medication and that's that that's all there is to it I don't take medication I don't sleep I'll be up all night I will be up for days if I don't take medication irritable I'm tired well lately you know just a little anxious really you know I just recently made a move to a new apartment has a lot of expenses and new experiences and things like that and I will new furniture and leave this and that that you have to get a managed to do all that but the whole thing was kind of stressful POF no not PTSD we are that was back in I think 2004 because my life has gotten so stressful to the point where it was either I had to do something or or in something to tell you the truth yes yeah I think it's useful you know what's a good sounding board you know someone to throw you know your concerns out and we'll discuss things that may be bothering you are good things to eat with medication cuz I've been going to therapy the changes a lot of changes I've been more focused more hopeful it is just been a good experience for me which is why I've been saying to go really happy well I can feel really happy by some currents I can't think of anything right now just like that and then I go back to how I was feeling so I can't really pinpoint anything really I mean I mean something comes to me unexpectedly or things go right for a change and continue to go right as opposed to things going wrong all the time that makes me happy when things go right how about that something I did recently but I really can I live with somebody that I really enjoyed being really really enjoyed recently I can't think of anything I don't have a best friend my best qualities or that I'm an honest person I genuinely give people the benefit of the doubt everyone in my book is as they appear to be until they prove prove it differently very generous overly generous and I'm very I like to help other people I mean help them come on a personal level and help people problem is it gives me pleasure to do something for somebody that's helping their mouth anything I regret how so it's only one thing I regret and that is sad after my twins that became old enough to start going to school at the elementary school level I was taking some courses as a pre-law major and at the time I was married to their father turned out not to be a good fit for me and because of the stresses involved with him well knowing that that was running and I was going to leave him I dropped out of college that was my biggest regret stay in school no matter what stay the course no matter what but I'm a good person I'm a good human being fo okay goodbye that's going to go go by are you done okay I was weird I was a little weird I was a little nervous with very gradually rising, trembling, very low, very small pitched voice",0
33,419,"I'm going to bring this doorbell over here thank you are you okay with this yes I'm good thank you I was born in Mexico City yes I'm about 34 years ago yeah I tried to go back once a year but I haven't been in about 3 years I haven't had the time and I've traveled other places but I'm planning on going back probably next year okay how does it compare to LA well I can't ever see myself moving back to Mexico City it's a huge huge City and I like La more there's more opportunities and I just feel at home here my family moved here like I said I was very young and my parents moved to California to work and then we just stayed here I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer I love traveling I have not traveled as much as I would like to but I do love to travel just seeing these things meeting people from other countries to stop feeling relaxed and having no worries because you're on vacation I just love being in other places the last trip I took was a 7-Day cruise and it went to St Thomas Barbados St Lucia Dean Martin and it was amazing I would love to do that trip again I think going to Mexico the last time I was there I went to the pyramids still see what's going on and I had not been there in many years and it just was amazing to see the pyramids and I can't even imagine how they were able to build such great structures I consider myself more sigh in social situations I kind of feel uncomfortable I'm not one to just go up to people and start conversations if people come up to me of course I'll talk to them but I feel slightly awkward just kind of out of place at a party I actually studied history I've always been interested in history and I just wanted to learn about histories from other cultures and of course US history so I'm very interested history I'm actually working in the education field what's your dream job my dream job would actually be traveling around the world and having a show on like the Travel Channel that would be my dream job because I would get paid to travel and it's something I enjoy to do doing so I would love to do that as a job I love reading and I love taking baths so to relax I like to take a bath and I read while I'm in the bath and I also like going to the gym that helps me deal with stress and it actually relaxes me even though I'm exercising I used to be not very good at controlling it when I was a kid I would get mad very easily and sometimes as an adult I still get angry easily but I've gotten a lot better at trying to think about things first before saying them and not having outbursts things like that the last time I argued with somebody was probably about a week ago it was my best friend and she actually she has kids lie down and for some reason she thought or thinks that I think I'm a better person than she is and because I went to school and she didn't and she's home with the kids and you know I'm able to do more things I don't think I've ever made her feel that I've been I definitely know I don't feel like I'm better than her but for some reason she accused me of that and we had an argument about it tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle different well that's situation I wish I had handled differently because when she was talking to me she was very upset and I started off pretty, I'm just trying to reason with her and let her know that I certainly didn't feel like I was better than her butt towards end of the conversation it just kind of turned into a yelling match between the two of us and I wish I had been able to just stay calm and maybe ask her to call me later when she calm down instead of just continuing the argument I was angry at first but once we hung up I felt really bad about the situation I felt that maybe I could have just let her let out all her feelings and then try to speak to her calmly instead of yelling at her to ever had oh wow that's a tough one I think cuz I think one of the hardest decisions I've had to make is breaking up with a boyfriend of 7 years although I knew that it was the right thing to do I was kind of hanging on to the fact that we have been together for so many years and I kind of felt by ending the relationship I would have wasted those last 7 years of my life so is a pretty tough decision to make but I realize that it was the best decision for me at the time and I'm actually glad I did because then I went on to meet my husband thank you about me bag or something that you wish you could erase from me well about I would say maybe 15 years ago I was hanging out with a couple of friends at a club and they met some guys and they invited us back to their place and I really didn't want to go because I didn't know these people and I mean I knew their names and that's about it but my friends really wanted to go and I wasn't the one driving so I decided to just go along with them and back at their house one of the guys actually pulled me into a room and try I got scared I yelled he tried to choke me and I thought I was going to die right there right there and I was going to kill me but likely one of my friends knocked on the door because she heard me scream and we left so it could have been a worse situation but I still think about it and wish that I could erase it from my mind it was we have a pretty good relationship I am close to him I have a sister and a brother my sister is two years younger and my brother is two years older and we got along pretty well my sister and I used to be best friends but then we grew apart and then and now we're actually closer I think than ever and I have a pretty good relationship with my parents my dad still treats me like I'm a little kid sometimes way to annoys me but I think we have a pretty good solid relationship how easy is it I usually wake up a few times throughout the night so I think it's rare for me to sleep the whole night through ever and I do feel a little like tired in the morning when I wake up it's hard I'm not a morning person definitely so yeah it's kind of hard to get a good night sleep I don't know I have a hard time falling asleep and then sometimes I have bad dreams or I need to get up to use the restroom but yeah I don't remember the last time I actually slept the whole night without waking up at least once emotionally good I'm actually on vacation right now from work so that's really nice physically I feel good I haven't been to the gym in a while so that kind of makes me feel bad cuz I like working out but health-wise I'm good no no it was a lot this past weekend I actually went out of town with my husband we didn't go very far we went to Santa Barbara but we really enjoyed ourselves we went wine tasting and went to the beach and just had a really good time how your best friend describe she would probably describe me as a good caring person patient very shy to place a 2 that I have a hard time saying no to people when they ask me for favors cuz I'm always doing things for other people so yeah that's how I think she would describe me I wish I was more outgoing I wish that I what else definitely more outgoing so I could have more friends I don't have a large group of friends because I am very shy I also wish that I could have more patience than I do sometimes I'm very sorry to Paisans and I wish I could find a better job so I could do more traveling yes I actually took a really long time after high school to go back to school and get my degree and I really wish that I could have you know taking care of it a lot sooner than I did and I also regret spending seven years of my life with my ex-boyfriend advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago I would have told myself to stay focused on school that going out and hanging out and just you know going to parties was not as important as I thought it was and that my education should always come first I'm proud but after so many years of not being in school I was able to go to UCLA and get my degree yeah that would be my proudest achievement okay thank you bye with very gradually rising, very trembling, very low, very small pitched voice",0

here then I have my baby and I just ate different food the people get along way I don't get it it's kind of a culture shock tell me about out there just on the food bases they like to give you a lot of food that tastes real good for a little bit of money to keep a lifelong customer but out here they want to go up there and give you a little bit of food for a whole lot of money so they just make it Mike parent have business out here not our got to get used to anymore the views in the ocean just splitting of people that's it just a few places what do you enjoy getting in to see different people on learn how different people get along and interact with each other I want to hear about your trip I remember years ago where I went to Mexico with my brother yeah jumping into a lake pretty much off the side of a mountain yeah everything it's not a subject I don't like actually my dream job working with computers and helping people that's where my heart is I like computers and also like helping people sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver I meditate workout I'll run I walk alright read in the median I'd say very good oh yeah that doesn't make it seem that good last time I argued was over someone actually spitting out a racial slur or it's my wife angry upset her disrespected and especially when I went up there that treat the person actually I was treating them with dignity and respect and trying to help the person the first no problem people are people how to Chance in school with a really go a lot further than I did and I let something very small and meaningless stopped me in the pursuit of it ignorance for lack of a better word now that I think back on it I could have done a whole lot to avoid it but I was just young and foolish start loving again much pain as I've seen in the world tell me about a compilation of all the events are just different bad things that I've seen if I could change it I would but sometimes I guess things are there for a reason even though we may not understand it I have no answer to that blood family really don't talk my wife don't know if she really wants to be there with me or not she thinks that I'm doing everything in the world but that I'm not really I don't understand I know my daughter loves me but I don't know if she wants to be with me or not because when somebody talks to you when I say something a certain amount of times in the tonnage in a voice and a belief in their eyes if you say something so many times it would really lies in your heart so you can say whatever through your mouth but it's what really is there I love my daughter she's Angel I'll cut her umbilical cord went out there and put on her first shirt I seen her come out she looked at me right out the stomach she wouldn't she was fighting with the doctors wouldn't let him touch her a bit I talked to her I told her to calm down I told her it was daddy she looked up at me grab my fingers and like just calm down and just let him do everything they needed to do no it's constantly changing fast what you have to do on this day won't be the same thing as the next or the next after that it's constantly what is a better word for adjusting the hardest thing I'll probably say is Spalding your child because you know you're doing it out of love for not learning the wrong lessons seeing your baby smile and appreciation I try to guard my baby a lot more from things that she sees when I was younger there were a lot of things I seen that no child or adult should have seen and I grew up I swore to myself that always take care of my child and I wouldn't disappear let her be around things like that okay my foster parents can you tell me about they basically showed me no matter where you come from you can always strive to get better okay how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep a good night sleep it comes the same just tired of yarn have I been feeling Ike I have a wealth of queries and a well that goal within my grasp and it's just right out of my route because I just need that one connector to really just see what I'm capable of and I know I'm capable of a lot it's just I need to make that connection no not PTSD no I said yes but I don't figure on many more depressed or anything than any other person everyone has their different breaking points okay tell me about the last time

don't think about everyday well one of my trips I went I went to Singapore and then to Thailand and it was when I was with my ex-boyfriend and we went to he had he was a sales engineer for a systems engineer but he he did well that year and so this is kind of like a company thing so we went to Singapore for a few days and that was really interesting you know of course it's a lot different over there it's not just like going to Canada or something but they had a big reception in the evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principles of company which is all fun and after Singapore we did some chores in Singapore this really isn't interesting experience it's really clean there and it's really it's not a lot of crime but the government is very is it's a little bit imposing but it was very interesting then we went to Thailand and that was almost as really completely different cuz like jungle we went to Phuket little island and it was just it was very primitive compared to Singapore just in a lot of different ways with her and just bring it was nice and everything was very cheap had a massage on the beach for $8 and it was interesting he has an hour for $8 well I'm in school right now and I didn't I didn't finish school and I was younger because and had health problems so here I am I'm I'm just doing my General Ed right now I'm going to SMC yeah I'm happy call my dream job would be to be a veterinarian but I probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily ocelot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and and in a Veterinary capacity I think I'm right on the cusp it depends on the environment and the people I'm with and how comfortable I am but I'm really outgoing when I feel comfortable with people and I'll be really reserved if I'm not well I mean aside from sleeping I like like relaxing things like going for a bike ride on the Strand or if I'm at home I'll just like reading a lot of times I can just lay there and my mind might be doing things but I'm kind of relaxing I really good I don't have I would say there's certain things that they can really like make me like when I see Injustice has or things like that then I mean I can really feel it but I never just likes laugh a handle or throw things or even you know yell show me some arguments I mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument I would say last summer when I think it was after a baseball game there's a group of us and we went to we went to have shabu-shabu after the game and and I think and I know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like she's a good friend in some ways and she's a traffic kind of distant in other way so I don't consider her like someone that I would confide in and you know it was any problems but sometimes we just have she's very touchy and she's got the same sense of humor I do so I think she had said something to me during the night which kind of bother me but you know I just kind of that's just how she is and then I guess I said some things that she spell were I wish he gets really offended easily I think but after that we didn't talk for a while but then we then one day she called me up and then we're friends again but like she never has never confronted me ever had hardest decision it was leaving my ex-boyfriend how did you do well it wasn't it was a long time coming I mean I was thinking about it for like 5 years you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he's a really good guy but we just had a lot of we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements so I had thought about it and thought about it and we are already engaged but we've been together for a long time so I don't know I was always is always on my mind like should I get married or should I not and then finally we were just always having we're always went with the word I'm looking for we were just having these little snippy disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and I just decided that I was going to leave and I did it was really hard it was it was the hardest decision of my life and I can say that definitively and but I I think it was for the best who's probably leaving my job for well to help my friend start a business in Nevada and when I when I I really like my job I mean it was it was pretty good it was right over at the beach and when I told him that I was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me in a different position which is awesome and that was really stressful for me because I already promised my friends have to leave I would have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't for her wanting me to come over there it was really really stressful and I stress over it for about three weeks until I actually laughed and when I went over there like we had we had made agreements about how much they were going to pay me and blah blah blah when I got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that I needed a certain amount and the other principles of the company where you know it was a hard situation cuz she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much and also they were a different religion and it was very strange and they were all when I was I was surrounded by Mormons and I don't have anything against Mormons but it was very different because I was kind of an outsider there and then also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there so I would say that's when it's it's it's it just a pivotal point in my life and I think that I really wish I had just stayed well if you can erase something from my memory then I would probably say memory like really if if I could erase something from my memory what would I want to erase everything can we think of anything I mean even like that that bad decision that I made you know it has value in it so I can't really say that I would want something erasing maybe if I was like raped or something and it was really horrifying then I would but I don't well if your time about being in a deep sleep I'm in a deep sleep a lot but I never feel rested and that's it's a medical problem of mine can you tell me well I always feel like I haven't slept for two days and there are points in in the day I would say during some days are points in the day where I really feel alert and alive and and rested but their short-lived but I sleep a lot I sleep pretty crappy physically pretty crappy no thanks now I haven't been officially diagnosed with depression but that's that's usually what doctors like my sleeping problem hasn't been diagnosed I'm I'm in the process of really working to get it diagnosed but that's the first thing that they try and figure out they they've given me like depression drugs before but they haven't helped with my sleep but I do I do I would say I feel down sometimes my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down I would say that I do feel down sometimes a lot of time but it's not I would say is reasonable considering the situation that I'm in okay I need triggered by something they're just triggered by Tech that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult but I wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular oh there I mean I mean for a long. Of time or every night I experience happiness like when I go out with friends or I go and you know I've find some great new dish I like I mean what type of Happiness are you looking for well I mean right now my friend just had surgery and so I'm staying with her this week I'm really enjoying it I mean even though we could never live together I can never live with live with her long-term and I'm sure she couldn't live with me long term but I'm having fun and you know she just she installed the Groupon app on her on her phone yesterday cuz she's been paying too much for laser hair removal installed it on her phone and then today she's she's looking up cupcakes so she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her as a Groupon deal so I mean you know there's a little fun things like that how your best friend are you probably OCD and probably thinks I'm pretty prissy compared to her I think that she would say that have a good heart or very different it probably that I am I should ask her I know we go out so I think she say that I'm fun but she has mentioned that I'm I'm a very private person and that I know I've I knew before she said that why I have what I told you I have I have a lot of problems right now and so I don't really tell people about them it is kind of a kind of a killjoy but also people can feel I feel that people can feel less comfortable if they perceive that you have a have difficulties and they feel kind of it's just uncomfortable like oh they maybe they should help her they feel guilty but they have busy lives so it's kind of traits of gaap but I would say even before even before this difficult time in my life I've been I put a private person I don't know why I think a lot and I'm a deep thinker and maybe it's a you know it not like I feel like I feel abnormal but maybe I just have a lot of thoughts that don't seem doesn't seem appropriate to share with people or not sure well one thing that I regret right now is yeah I haven't really found somebody you got to spend the rest of my life with so I would tell myself to concentrate more on that cuz once you hit 40 it's it's it's a lot harder I would say that I persevered I'm very proud that even though I have a lot of difficulties in my life the fact that I'm a male making this commitment to go to school and I'm doing it on my own and you know it's it's kind of a if people if people knew all the problems today have they be like well you know why are you worried about school but I really feel that you know I'm I'm doing this and I'm really proud that even through everything and getting a raise okay thanks hi with very gradually rising, very trembling, very low, small pitched voice",0

he gave me at the midst of dealing with a third party which was the Department of Consumer Affairs and because of that I took him to small claims court and I end up losing the whole settlement and only been offered a very small portion so I wish I would have taken the higher road to taking a lower Road I don't tend to feel guilty about too many things tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make hardest decision I don't know financially emotionally emotionally letting go of past relationship the hardest thing to say the hardest thing but it was a difficult thing can you tell me about yes it was a relationship of 7 years but that person is already moved on so they want me to be in their life and hopes that if something goes wrong with my current relationship will always have something to fall back on that sounds really hard oh yeah it is hard tell me about your bag or something that you wish you could erase from your in advance so that I can trace for my memory I don't know there's a lot of events that I just automatically erased from my memory but whatever comes to mind right probably the death of a relative I'm alone and misinformed because I didn't know

finding PTSD they were trying to link depression you still go to therapy now no financially I'm not capable and I haven't found a counselor who's willing and committed to working with me and helping me with my issues I find a lot of counselors they listen to me and then they laugh at me and then they tell me the opposite of what's what I'm telling them last time I felt really happy I really don't know that's a good question something you did recently that you really enjoy just just do what I want I just relaxed I just relaxed and you know I don't know I don't have any best friends my best qualities that I'm hard-working I'm reliable I'm an excellent friend I'm energetic and I'm going to go get her things that I wish I could change about myself probably be less sensitive don't take things so personally and learn how to help myself before helping others no I don't have any regrets in my life if I could do things differently 10 years ago I probably would have focus and study more and less being out of the house and hanging with friends what are you most proud of in your life baguette have a college education and I'm self-sufficient and I can pay my bills by myself and I'm alive goodbye hi so then where you at that was exactly with very gradually rising, very trembling, very low, small pitched voice",0
38,424,"where's my little button are you bringing okay all right yeah she looks like human okay okay alright okay you're welcome are you okay with this yes today is a wonderful day I'm doing just absolutely marvelous I was born in Cleveland Ohio I was raised in Tucson Arizona and came to Los Angeles when I was 16 years old yes I've only been back once since I left Soho another Community when I was going up I'm so glad I grew up there because it was a great sense of community which I think we don't have here in Los Angeles my grandmother died and left property for my father so we came here to manage her property property it was pretty easy for me I was still young and it was easier to adapt so I'm pretty good at meeting people that has never been a problem I travel a lot as a child so I was used to moving and going to new places meeting new people seeing new things it's an adventure and I like The Adventurous life oh one of my best troops I had it was in nineteen I'm dating myself but 1964 I came out here to visit my grandmother from Cleveland Ohio and I went to an Indian reservation and I got a little note card about the reservation when I got back home I wrote to the reservation and I told him I when I went back to school in September I would have to write deliver a speech rather about what I did over the summer and I told them I wanted to talk about going to the Indian reservation and what they send me something and they sent me this huge Cucina Indian down and that was that was a wonderful experience to have the thing is worth now if I still had it I found out like a quart of a million-dollar so but that's one of the best person I can be a little bit of both I'm pretty when I have to be I can be outgoing cuz I'm good at talking to people and meet people but sometimes I have a little bashful side-by-side me to the little bit of both I study business administration with a emphasis in marketing and advertising I'm really I started in computer science but that was back in the day when computer science wasn't is what it is today and I'd like I was good at it but it wasn't any interaction with people and I love people so I wanted something that would bring me interaction with people so I wouldn't a marketing and I was working for a TV station where I was going to school so that fit in line in marketing advertising so no now I'm a photographer I'm a celebrity photographer I shoot a lot of stars I shoot on the red carpet I shoot a lot of special events and anything of people will pay me for it's not hard at all this my passion I love it is like not working I'm in my dream job I just need to get more jobs that pay pay me well because there's a lot of times as photographer you have to do a lot of things event for free to get known so it's a building process of relationships I'm still in that process of building relationships so that I can get more pay jobs but this is my dream job I love what I do okay well now I'm really back into it I used to do it a while that I got away from it but this meditation I practice meditation I try to do it twice a day in the morning and at night before I go to sleep I work with Oprah and Deepak Chopra and anybody else who provides me with meditation and I use that too, bye I can really control my temper sometimes I get set off I guess like any other human being but I work at trying to keep it moderate and temperate temperature and personality oh wow we argued with my daughter the other day about something I said and I did not mean to say it to hurt her but it obviously did and we argued about that what my intentions were my intentions were never to hurt her and maybe what I said did and that's what started sergeant oh God I felt terrible because I never intended to hurt my daughter and I never wanted to hurt her and I feel bad that she had been hurt by what I have said I had to have the guard my word to watch my thoughts but I don't have much of a relationship with my with my brothers and sisters and mother and father my parents live far away so it's just my two daughters here with me and we have a pretty good relationship you know we try to work my my daughters and makeup artist I'm a photographer so we work a lot together in the industry so sometimes I think we're up on each other to close we need a little more space yeah when I say the wrong things no is never easy to be a parent it's like working progress making the right decisions about things sometimes the love the show look feeling of accomplishment that you were able to raise the highest creation on this planet to be a wonderful and productive human being I'm not as strict as my parents where I give my kids a little more freedom to find out who they are I'm not real religious like they do but I am very spiritual so I brought them up different from me on the religious tip and more I listen more to them I think than what my parents did it was you were to be seen and not heard when I was growing up and I let my kids voice be here what's something you feel guilty about one night I had a bad night that changed my life and I don't want to go into details I feel bad about that night yeah I could have stayed home go out and trying to think about it and situation maybe those handling of how I me and my husband divorced I think I could have handled that a little differently well we we I think we really loved each other a lot and we just it was it was something that had come to an end and the way we separated was kind of explosive and I think both of us could have handled it better but I think I played a part in keeping a lot of drama going because I was hurt that we were breaking up and kind of devastated because I wanted my child to be raised for their father so I think Looking Back Now which is you know hindsight is 20/20 vision I could have handled things a little better but what can you do you do the best that you can at that time if you knew better you do better tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to the hardest decision I've ever had the hardest decision ever had to make was I was on my way to work as an enrollment counselor on the plane had a stroke was going to making a connection and to get on the other plane to and then go to the hospital and a doctor was sitting behind me and he told me that I could not get on that plane because I might have another stroke it was a hard decision cuz I was in Dallas Texas all by myself I did not I mean I was in there with the employee but I would be left all by myself cuz my employees have to go on to Montgomery Alabama where we were headed and I had to make a decision should I stay or should I go but my life was in the balance so I made the decision to stay and go to the hospital but that was a hard one overwhelmed I mean here I am on my way to work you know I flew to different state every week and they help kids get get admitted into college and here I am on my way to work and I'm on a plane and I feel this weird feeling coming over the left side of my body and I say my prayers when I go to sleep and then when I wake up to get off the plane I can't remove my luggage from the overhead compartment which I did every week so I knew something was wrong it was it was when you see your life in the whole world in your hand and you don't know what's going to happen next so it was very disturbing very traumatic and you know you don't know what's happening to you is so the weirdest thing riding to the hospital in a medical ambulance that was a weird experience I'm sorry but I'm here you know I've survived is a doctor told me nobody survives it a stroke on a plane and I survived so Universe wasn't finished with me yet how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep you know it's that sometimes I have a little problem with it sleeping a little bit sometimes I I get wired up I get wired up just because I'm one of those real energetic persons and I have to finish what I set out to do and until I finished I can't go to sleep so sometimes it's hard for me to go to sleep by the time I can lay down and just go but depends on what's going on in my head what are you sluggish probably a little on edge but I try to keep a puppy personality I'm really energetic person so I try to but you know if your tired your body is still talking to you so lately I've been feeling really well except I've been having some problems because I have a since I had two stroke I have nerve damage in my head and in my face and so I just it's I thought it's been over a year since I had two stroke but I thought by now it would have gotten a little better and it has it but I'm so grateful to be alive that that is really my minor compared to the bigger picture and I wasn't fortunately my I didn't lose my facial structure or you know my face is not screwed up like a lot of people are I still can use my hands I still beat you with my camera but my left hand is is diminished and use but I can shoot with my right hand as a photographer so I can still keep doing my work so you know I have to keep a good upbeat energies going on for me to keep for me to be successful no but I went through depression from being knocked unconscious five times and I was a schoolteacher every ball there was that you could name soccer ball baseball basketball name that ball hit me in my head and I suffered from having like sleep apnea not been able to sleep from being hit so many times and knocked unconscious in the head no only I don't go to therapy because I don't I don't have any medical right now so I'm not able to get therapy they only offered that to people with medical hard to get it and I'm not work yet sucks I'm not working right now because I'm still trying to get my disability so that I can get well cuz I'm going to be a fulfilled human being and I want to be totally and you know the system it'll be almost two years before I go for a hearing so that's kind of depressing to think after all the years I've been working since I was 16 and it's taking me it's been over a year or the year I had two stroke February 2012 and we are now in March of 2013 and I won't have a hearing until September 2013 just to tell me if I get the disability or not that's been very depressing for me because I'm wondering where I lived off my savings in the last year and I got put my daughter through college you finished and now she's having to take care of me and she still looking for a job and my life is kind of up in the air right now and some wonder what goes what comes next and so I'm just praying for guidance I feel happy every day every day I wake up and I can breathe and I can see and I can walk and I can talk and I can still shoot my photograph I'm happy it's just a good thing to be in the present moment and to be alive and you know what I figured I'd look at it regrets you can't change the past all you can do is change right here and right now so just move for it what advice would I pay myself don't let anything get in your way you know keep a good personality an energetic spirit and just keep pushing energetic talkative won't take no for an answer follow through reliable good-spirited giving loving I'm most proud of that I have been able to find out my creative side I've been a visual artist I never took an art lesson before I taught art I was in my late twenties before I even discovered that I can draw and paint I'm a doll collector I'm at my creative side is what I'm most proud of because it's been able to help me being creative I can no matter what even when I was still very ill from having a stroke I could still go out and just go take pictures and that was so soothing to myself that I'm glad I'm glad that I have a creative side of that I found it and have utilized it is that it why no that was kind of therapeutic that really was therapeutic. Go back here okay oh okay I'm sorry with very gradually rising, steady, very low, very small pitched voice",0
39,425,"all right okay thank you and please are you okay with yes I'm okay doing a little tired and worried well I am looking for a place to live and I don't have a job right now so things are you sore a little shaky for me these days where do you live I'm staying with my son in Venice it's pretty good but both of us need to have our own space so that's why I'm looking for another place to live originally from New York but I've been in California since the early 70s yeah I moved to LA because I had been living in Portland Oregon and I was getting tired of the weather up there and my son was down here so it seems like a good place to be how easy was it for you to get used to living in LA and it wasn't too hard I I met people right away and I just really liked it here so it was it was easy to connect with people the weather is number one for most people I love being near the ocean I like the energy I like if they are like the artistic culture well everybody loves the traffic and me loves the weather and hates the traffic so I kind of feel I feel the same way sometimes it gets a little wearing that it's so busy and the fact that it's so expensive makes it difficult I see what you mean I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer you travel a lot I know not as much as I'd like if if I had more and more income more friends I would travel more I mostly have been may I travel as let's say so my longest trips it was out of the country was to Mexico and I traveled drove down with a friend down to Oaxaca and the whole trip we took about about 4 weeks going down and back from the Bay Area yeah that was a fun trip well we've been working together on the census and if she had made that trip a few times and invited me to come along with her from that trip I would say we were in Oaxaca for a Day of the Dead so it was celebrating Day of the Dead with the family in the little village that we were staying in at everybody in the village makes an altar in their house for their loved ones who have passed away and they also decorate clean and decorate the graves so there were lots of flowers and it was just it was neat to be there and be with that family celebrating that I studied I was in the liberal arts program but I didn't stay stay only stay in school for in college for a couple of years but I was most interested in Liberal Arts and Humanities dream job my dream job would be personal assisting somebody who was in a creative field and getting to travel and go to events with them how hot is it it's hard to break into I'm starting now very minimally with somebody who I'm doing more of a volunteer work with and I'm I'm working on building up some of my skills so that I can be doing more of that I'm fairly I'm kind of a friendly introvert so you know I have no trouble meeting people I don't hold back and you know I just am not like shy at parties I'll go up and talk to people but I am over all kind of introverted so I prefer one-on-one then big groups I like to watch I like to watch improvement shows like HGTV I like to watch I agree model shows and and see Transformations or watch movies or read I play some Solitaire on my my Kindle Fire okay how are you at controlling your temper I don't usually realize I'm mad until later it doesn't really come up and I just tend not to have the kind of life where those situations arise us sometime soon of sometimes on the road I get a little annoyed I don't get annoyed so much I like when people cut me off or anything like that but when people are deliberately rude and and you know honk for no reason or you know it when they get angry because maybe I've done something inadvertent nail cut them off by mistake and you know like they get really angry then that makes me angry and return When was the last time you argue with yeah I like I said I don't really get into arguments I did have I was with a friend the other day and she got annoyed with me because she felt like I was correcting her so it wasn't really an argument but she I had said something that she heard as a correction while it was a correction and she got angry well then I felt criticized and I felt I felt vulnerable I wasn't it was it was pretty uncomfortable well in that situation I didn't I didn't have to correct her so I think that's something I'm starting to look at in myself is my need to be right so in general that's I'm trying to to catch that and just let people make mistakes with without my telling them about it I don't know that's Tuff I can't know that I've had that much trouble making decisions well hard for me to decide to put my cat to sleep when he was sick oh it was and I had to give up a cat and I was moving once and and that was difficult to well in the case of the first cat the one that was sick I decided when the vet said that he thought it was the Humane decision and with cat I had to give up I didn't I didn't really decide I was moving to a place that where I couldn't take her and so I thought I found somebody who could take her say that stuff I don't really have that the erasing from the memory part there's nothing I really wish I could erase from my memory trying to think of something that I've done that I wish I hadn't done oh okay I remember something they were there was a time when I was I was in a class at Junior College it was a film class and I was I was the one who was after we we went out and did a little film project and we're supposed to bring it back into class the next week I was the one who had the film and through different just things that were happening in my life right now and never went back to the school but I never brought them to film back so all the work they have done I had to do over again and I still feel bad about that but it's pretty easy sometimes I wake up in the early morning hours and and have trouble going back to sleep but that's not very often how to concealing lately I've been feeling kind of tired and low-level depressed like not feeling a lot of options no yes I have oh there were two times there was once back in like 1970 290 about 1972 or 3 and then another time oh so then would that have been in bed 16 years ago just feeling like there wasn't you know feeling the feeling that things weren't going to change if I didn't get some help and that if I I didn't have to let you know that maybe if I got some medication that would help me and the short-term I'm not going to therapy right now Travis moving around alot finances there wasn't really feeling the need starting to think it might be an

48,434,"yes I am I'm doing very good today I'm originally from Chicago Illinois moved out here when I was three yes I never go back family issues it depends on what you're into if you're into the fast life and Hollywood it doesn't compare at all if you're into the cold weather than you would rather be out there I like the sun my mom and my dad split up it's okay I have no idea I was only three when I moved out here I like the sunshine I like the weather I like the balance of the weather we have in the spring winter fall and end in the summer I like the beaches I like Hollywood I like that the Lakers are here and I love the people is is a different variety I think La is a microcosm of the United States people from all over the world come to the United States and people from all over the country and all over the world they come to La for a better opportunity so that's why I like about la no gang violence no not really I travel one time to Arizona and one time the Stockton California and another time to Barstow California but I don't do much traveling right now because of finances study alcohol and drug counseling I just filled it in my I just got into my heart that that's who I was supposed to be doing with my life is helping people overcome their addiction so that was kind of easy choice I got some advice from people and I just went into it to do it just just to see what it was and finish school it internship and got hired and so I believe that's what I'm supposed to be doing with my life I'm not working right now I actually moved away and I had to I was married and we had to move away we moved away because rent was cheaper so I actually had to give up that job in order to make that move but since I came back down I've been filling out applications and sending resumes and trying to get interview so I can get back into counseling well it can be it can be very difficult at times because I have a felony and and so I can't work with you and I can work with the elderly and but the regular dose I can and then you have to be certified and I'm not certified yet you have to work a certain amount of hours in order to be certified before they even like you to take the test you after work a certain amount of hours so right now I'm just trying to get into interns you know try to intern and show people what I can do as a counselor because everything about me is not seen them my resume and yeah they just want people to be certified not being certified the experience and the fact that I have a felony makes it hard and my dream job is to open my own facility or as an author you know that the that depends on on on people mainly I mainly adapt my personality to the people that I'm around if people are perky that I'm going to be perky if they're standoffish then I may seem shy but I'm not sure I'm just giving them their space and allowing them to decide when they want to open up but if people open up right away then I open up right away I mean listen to music or I watch YouTube write poetry I'll just close my eyes and just lay down and pretend like I could sing which I can't so that's and nothing I do is I eat ice cream controlling my temper I'm very very good at it it depends on what it is I have to say that last time I lost my temper because I felt like somebody was scaring my mother so I lost my temper but ninety-nine times out of hundred I don't lose my temper don't like to raise my voice and I just like to be calm and cool and I like everybody to be comfortable I don't want anybody be frightened or anything there's no reason for anybody be frightened and for us to be angry and you know taking out our past frustrations out on people who had nothing to do with it I just believe that and I believe angry outbursts to be a link to heart problems and high blood pressure so I definitely don't want that well I was just telling you about it was it was my mother's husband and tell you the truth I could have handled that differently but when I seen the look in my momma's eyes of fear I just lost it and I snapped you know I told my mother like I don't like this you need to take care of this because I'm don't know how long I can keep my composure as far as this cuz I've been seeing this guy mistreat my mother mistreat my mother but that's her husband and so I kept my distance in a relationship but when I saw her having fear in her eyes that triggered a part of me dad I don't like very much because I know if I get angry I usually stay angry for a long time so I should have just left I should have just left and went home and rested and got up the next morning with the church but yeah we had a big Time Explosion and they had created and that created a lot of damage for about six to nine months so yeah those 6 9 months I can't get back yes well my brother in prison I haven't seen him in 20 years he's been there 20 years my sister move to Chicago 13 years ago I haven't seen her since then so I'm only close to my mother and my son I haven't seen him in 5 years and I'm still looking for him and waiting for the day I see him again and how that's going to turn out for me I just you know I have small family and I have family in Chicago but I don't mess around with that side of the family just just because of what I seen and heard so I just don't want it to happen to me at all so I just keep my distance has been a positive influence in my life I would say taught me how to get my temper under control and how to express my emotions without me expressing my emotions being threatening to someone else and talked taught me how how to like monitor my emotions in monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are and when they're really strong that's when I just need to be quiet until that intense spelling subsides and then I can speak rationally and not just emotionally and of course he's he was the one that told me that I should look into being a drug and alcohol counselor he's got 27 years clean and sober right now he used to live on skid row and the way he changed his life around and you know the way he approached me as a father was just something that I'll never forget feel guilty about my grandfather pass away in 2004 and at that time I was just getting out of prison 2002 I was just getting out of prison and he came to see me and he told me in so many words that he wasn't going to be around for that much longer but I didn't get it cuz I had a lot of drugs and alcohol my life at the time and my life is crowded with things that I consider to be more important than that plus the fact I didn't understand him what he was saying but when he died I figured out that he was telling me that I should probably spend more time with him before it's time for him to go but I couldn't see it then and I feel I think about it all the time erased from my memory will be the date my brother hit my mom I always Replay that over and over and over and over in my mind and it's like that's what Memories I can just go without replaying my mind over and over and over and over and over again so yeah that day that memory right there I feel conflicting feelings because I want hand on way hey my brother was protecting me from getting beat and on the other hand he was his my mom so time in the middle most nights I don't know I go to sleep maybe 3 in the morning and I'm proud I'm more than likely up at 7 in the morning so I don't get much sleep it depends it depends on the environment I mean if I don't sleep well I'm going eventually I'm going to be here to boo but doesn't happen right away it depends on my environment and who's around me if they're difficult people that's going to be a challenge for me and if people are easy going and no one would even know that I didn't get much sleep I've been feeling lately I just been feeling like Dad things are about to start going better for me maybe some better decisions taken advantage of the opportunities that come to me taking advantage of my talents taking advantage of meeting the right people that can open the right doors for me so I'm very enthusiastic about that even if it doesn't happen I'll send out a million resumes I don't care if I get 5 interviews I've I've never stopped because I know know that been a counselor is my life mission and and I'm also destined to be a writer and it's just a matter of time before my book is out there and people know about me because I found a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that and I have a lot to offer Humanity so it's just a matter of time before that the public is exposed to what I've been Gathering my behavior I'm more mellow I laughed more more humorous I let a lot of things go that I used to just let take me off and anger me and things that I can't control like trying to control people or or or trying to make sure people don't betray me and you just can't control that I think I matured mentally and psychologically and and the acquisition of a sense of humor was a major major breakthrough for me so I know my thoughts of change and with my thoughts changing my behavior has changed I still have to monitor it my thoughts and my behavior I still have to monitor them but overall you know back then I just tolerating myself now I actually like myself and it will boo boo hoo you to feel the same way no no I haven't no last time I feel happy was last night cuz the Lakers won the basketball game my best friend was described me he calls me the truth because I always tell the truth and people tried to hide stuff and I always refill it they can't hide it from me I have a statement that says I see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it and I see stuff days and months before they start happening I no human behavior when I see it and I sniff it out real well and it's just a gift that was given to me so he calls me the truth because of how I interact with people and how people have to come clean with me because when they look at me they know that I see through them like I said like a clear glass with nothing in it and yes that's why he calls me the truth I wish I would have never well obviously I wish I would have never went to prison I wish Falcon change well my economic status my employment status my teeth that's like a problem area for me I did a lot of stupid things years ago and it caught up with me and I didn't take care of my teeth and now that I need to be confident about myself as I can be you know it always comes up every now and then you know the thought like I wonder if they look when they're to look in that might if I never get the I never get the impression that they are but in the back of my mind there she starts that says are they looking at my teeth so I will really change that and I will change my physical size I think I would like to be at least 35 pounds heavier but I'm working on it 20 years ago which would make me 18 I would have at that time I was a big-time high school basketball player for Fremont High School and I had college is coming to see me and I would have given myself the opportunity was the to stay away from the troublemakers because I didn't and I blew my opportunity to play college basketball for Duke Blue Devils and who knows I could have been playing for the Lakers last night but hey I'm most proud of the fact that you know what I'm most proud of my mom really really she graduated from school she got a full-time job she got a full-time job she would wake up at 5 in the morning go to work get off her job at 3:30 go straight to the college lead to college at 9 at night she does this 5 days a week and still had the strength to maintain of she was on the Dean's List and President's List so doing all of this you know when they say that older people can do things I just think that's dispels that rumor and she recently got her license as a evangelist in the church so I'm just real proud of that and her life is been affecting people in a positive way so yeah Mama okay thank you goodbye okay oh did you know that she stopped oh okay okay with very gradually rising, very steady, high, very small pitched voice",0

It takes me it takes time for me to get to know people I mean I'm not a real party person I don't like to go to parties and meet people and things like that but if I'm among friends and think like that but I can be for the outgoing with people I know the drink wine yeah I drink wine maybe listen to some nice music pretty good I can I'm pretty good at controlling my emotions oh gosh I wouldn't say it was a real argument it was more like a discussion maybe about finances Maybe money I was just a little irritated but the not really not really strong emotional oh wow guys I can't think of anything at the moment so I'll look for the skip that one maybe eating eating more junk food than I admit to or the hardest decision I ever have to make Maybe buying a home buying a home or remodeling the home spending money for it was a I felt it was time to move on with my life and to buy a place for myself so I could be self-sufficient and independent yes very happy and then I could erase from my mouth when I when I was when I was student teaching for a year trying to get my teaching credential undiscovered I never enjoyed it I want a race that whole year 1983 it just brought back horrible horrible memories of what I went through when I was student teaching in the discovered that teaching K-12 with no not for me I stood my major was Spanish and linguistics what made you decide I was very good on languages and I thought them I enjoyed taking them and I was just having a good time taking foreign language and I was getting good grades so I thought maybe this is what I should go into foreign languages I was teaching I was in the Delta teacher teaching English as a second language for 30 years and I just recently decided to retire myself I have a pretty good relationship with my family with my mother and my sisters and my father passed away in 2008 and my relationship with my father wasn't as good as with my other family members fucked up on the phone the whole time we have pretty good relation with the with my family now pretty easy I don't have any problems if I don't sleep well I'm I may be moving around in the bed and messing up the sheets but that doesn't happen too often pretty good I think I've been feeling pretty good no major health problems or anyting no no no last time I was really happy I probably when spring break came around and with a vacation time and it was time to go on our trip yeah it was a it was a week trip up to Central Coast to Cambria and Pismo Beach and Santa Ynez was just the nice getaway relaxing on the hotel lawn and garden drinking wine and enjoying different sites and eating good food and then buying were going to replenish our dwindling Supply at home I think she would describe me as a kind and sweet and motivated and nice person oh sometimes I wouldn't mind being a little more outgoing I guess I tend to be more reserved so I wouldn't mind being more outgoing towards strangers and things with really badly about myself probably when I betrayed a confidence with some friends of mine when I take them when I tape them singing Christmas carols and I I played it to some other people and they found out and they really laid a guilt trip on me for doing that but it all got resolved at the end we all we became we were all hot it was just a bad misunderstanding on my part but it worked out okay probably having done what I did bikes playing at the other people what advice would I give myself 10 or 20 years ago and don't give up just keep keep pursuing what you want never never give up with CU does a hint of a disappointment if nothing if it doesn't work out I'm a I'm a good listener I'm I'm a motivated person I'm hardworking I'm conscientious I'm caring assembly a pretty happy type person something recently when I really enjoyed going to the going to the Festival of books at USC this weekend yeah that Festival of books is it's a festival where they have all these off authors and they have them food demonstrations seminars and all kinds of books available to look at and there is a lot of food and then a lot of authors signing books and things it's a great event for her to get out and end with nice weather to so it's nice to be out there I really enjoyed that thanks I'm most proud of most proud of probably being successful in my work and my life and my marriage and I just basically being happy with myself well you're welcome bye but it oh okay I wasn't sure if I was supposed to bring it over haha with very gradually rising, steady, high, very loud pitched voice",0
52,438,"okayyesI'm doing pretty good I was born and raised right here in Los Angeles the weather would be number one I also like the diverse cultures I like the fact that there's a lot of different things here you can do and it's a lot of opportunity here not just for myself but for my kids and I think it's really a great place to be when you're trying to establish a career go to school learn about different people the traffic the cost-of-living sometimes I think it's too big and that thinks the transportation system as far as the Bus and Train is long overdue they need to revamp it or you know add more buses and things like that just make it easier for people to get around on public transportation I travel when I can a little bit here and there I have not been overseas yet which is a goal of mine within the next couple of years so I've just travel domestically I try to take at least one trip a year somewhere I just like the fact of getting on the plane and going places I'm going to take me somewhere I've never been and learning about that place you know like so if I'm going to DC I really look forward to it cuz it's the historic City you know things like that my most recent trip would have been DC his last year I went to go visit a friend and I stayed about I think three to four days and they got to see the capital he showed me around showed me all the you know historic landmarks and sites the White House the Capitol Building I got to see a lot of other different government building and it was it was a good experience the irony was I had to fly on 9/11 and so that had me a little and easy but once I was in the plane up in the air I was okay and it was all good and once I was back home I was like yes but I I just the trip and I look forward to going back attending my friend's wedding she had a destination wedding in Hawaii actually Maui that was actually 233 years ago 3 years ago and all I guess and I've been trying to get back ever since and I want to take my kids and I just love it there and actually come look forward to two moving there one day I have three sons 13 year old twins boys and my youngest is also a boy he's eight they all have birthdays in June the twins are June 9th and my baby is June 4th and so they just a few days apart but five years apart technically and they're just super super typical boys active all over plays hormones puberty is actually an interesting time because you know the two older boys going through puberty their teenage years still trying to figure some things out for himself you know doing that transition stage of 8 to 9 years old so he'll be 9 in June and then my oldest if you 14 so it's a challenging time for me as well just the joy of watching what you put into being a parent everyday and seeing how just with love and nurturing and the right and you know when I can take proper development but just with you know love and nurturing how a baby grows into a toddler into you know a young boy to a teenager and an Italian man is so that experience alone has been rewarding just watching my sons grow up and go through these different stages and see how they have developed and you know seeing some of the things that they are going through now that's so reminiscent of my teenage years and it's just it's very rewarding in and actually I look forward to maybe even being a foster parent later down the line when they're older and often college cuz I really love children giving back probably a couple of things but I was just say for me being a single parent is the financial well I would say that along with some of the emotional with them having to Bear the brunt of the responsibility of just child child rearing you know the just the everyday things so what you have to deal with sometimes when you just tired you don't want to be bothered or you're trying to do things for yourself you have to be reminded that okay I got to cook or had to go pick my son up for I had to take him to baseball practice this one wants to go for hear this one is acting Moody and you know just those those types of challenges that's what was the financial and you know making sure you know you're able to put food on the table you're paying your rent and you know you keeping up with the day today and that's those two are probably the hardest things for me to deal with well I just take it day by day. I just put one foot in front of the other and I'm extremely spiritual so I just rely on God and pray a lot and meditate if I see a need a little help if you know I'm not above asking for help sell sometimes if I have to reach out to people or you know see what other resources are out there to help me you don't try to do that and so for me right now my biggest challenge is just trying to go back to school to put myself in a better economic situation so I can continue to provide for them comfortably I studied Communications actually I was a journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology and now I'm studying business I just thought that you know there would be more opportunities for me with business as far as jobs and then I you don't have a desire to go to graduate school so I just figured in the long run it was a better it will put me in a better position give me more opportunities with the communication just a little limited and especially as you get older the fields of TV report and things like that are kind of become you know harder to obtain so I just thought it I would going to something more realistic and you know but I like both fields are really do I like communicating riding reading talking as you can tell and sell the sea a couple probably but I would say ultimately would be traveling like working as like a travel writer going to different destinations trying different foods out writing about different people cultures learning in living you know about those different people and culture living amongst the you know that the people there and being interacted with the children and stuff like that so I kind of hope to be able to do that one day but yes it would be something along those lines and then the fall back will be the counselor and social worker something in that area if I could Encompass all three hopefully I can that I would like to do that that's a hard question probably because I initially grew up very shy in the not so much shy as I am reserved now but not Concerta but just reserved in you know what I go somewhere I'm checking everything everybody else out and then once I become comfortable or activates his situation and I'm like okay you know I warm up to the to the situation of the people but I'm also friendly I can be very friendly and outgoing you like to talk you know I seem like a chatterbox but I'm not really so usually if I'm in a big space with the whole lot of people I don't like to be the center of attention I can attach myself to one or two people and you know become friendly with them but I overall I am open Friendly person for me I could be something as simple as just unplugging everything all electronics and just sitting for a few moments meditating praying or reading a good spiritual scripture if I'm able to I like to go for a good massage maybe get a facial you know things that will I, like the physical part part of a like massages things that really release tension and if not then like I said just sitting at home reading and praying or I like the beach I love the beach so sometimes that driving go sit by the beach I'll also like to just maybe go and have lunch by myself at our get a mani pedi or maybe go window shopping you know things like that pretty good sometimes I'm just like I don't really have such an issue with the temper as I am I just a more impatient unfortunately a lot of times with people you know situations so I just can become really irritated or irritable quite agitated especially if it's that time of the month for me and just lose patience outside of that I'm actually pretty good I try to be very you know conscious of where I'm at and be very patient with people especially if I can see that the person is like if there's a new checkout person at the counter or cashier I do try to be I do try to be patient and understanding cuz I would want that you know if it were me I would want someone to explain that to me you know what my kids sometimes you know it's just a works both ways to lymphocyte time of the month I'm just I guess just leave me alone or I might have a short temper or short fuse so I am conscious of it I try to be aware of it and then try to monitor it but you know like anybody I'm human and there are times where I have my days are moments when I catches like I go off and just lose it well I haven't really had not presenting an argument but there's been an ongoing thing with American Express so I would say because it was not a personal contact with a company it really was an argument but I do know that I had some issues with American Express had to call in a bottle and I think Saturday and I'll tell I wasn't getting the response I expected inside look at the whole contact the call was just back and forth very frustrating and I was upset and you know the rap was trying over talk me you did I was trying to talk her so you know I don't know if you would consider that an argument but I would definitely say that's the last time when you know I just like reached my boiling point to say the least and was really upset and that I was the closest you know to an argument and then had to call back this morning that would be really up to delete an argument but it was a tense exchange for a minute or two probably the most recent contact and that would have been the one on Saturday with American Express actually was on Sunday yeah and I know the person trying to help me but you know when you're constantly being told different things and I've had to call in about five or six times about the same situation and it not be resolved it just takes you there so just are kept raising my boys said some things I shouldn't have. And just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact I like to really feel in control of the contact and so it just took me there my blood pressure was raised excuse me and that was just a kind of a mess for a while feel like maybe 30 minutes or an hour after that just irritable and agitated and upset and as far as always try to you know go back and pull from those and you know do my own sense of feedback and see how I can handle things differently but that's when I definitely wish I could have kept my cool and been more level-headed and and not really raise my voice and you know been more polite what have probably have had a couple but police demos is a situation years ago when I just had my sons and they probably by twin there probably about 2 and I was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and it just was not a good time and he pretty much scheudle was not comfortable with me having another child at the time and I wasn't comfortable with having another child either but wanted to keep the baby but you put me under so much stress and you know kind of thing I want to say really push me into having terminating the pregnancy and that's always stays with me and I've always missed that pregnancy that child I think about that that baby or what could have been I try not to hold any anger or resentment towards him or anybody but it but I know deep down inside secretly if I had it to do all over again I would have just I would have kept the baby and move forward so that would have been probably the hardest especially emotionally like a deal with a lot and I have dealt with a lot you know being unemployed or you know a lot of financial problems but that to me was the heart thank you no OK Google I was laid off in December so I've been constantly trying to do things to you know get back on my feet so that's been a little tough and I had to face a lot of challenges and dealing with that and issues with child support and trying to find another job and going back to school so I'm at my range of emotions have just have been just that arranged at a very good friend of mine now who we both started off you're on the same place about five years ago well she's been able to move forward and going with her lies and now she's graduating in next month from USC with her masters in social work so I'm feeling a little envious of that and I have been for like the past year but more so recently although I'm very very happy for her you know and she's a good person and she deserves it back of course you don't got it when she was me so that she was kind of been bothering me well I'm really good with them people I communicate well I like to talk really good with children that's why I would like to teach her be a counselor although I haven't got really tapped into it I know I'm a very creative person I know I write pretty good I could possibly be a creative writer but I know very creative soul is given the opportunity I know I could tap into that and really develop those skills something like with Maybe song writing fiction writing but probably like interior decorating anything artistic just anything cuz I love musical of Arts I love drama love plays Lubbock fashion buff but I do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that so I think those words are are my strong points as well as just getting along with people I know it would make a great counselor people my friends come to me all the time I have a good ear for listening I'm a great mediator and I know how to because I've been through a lot and one of my friends call me the voice of reason the one that's actually graduate from SC but I know I'm like light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to Insight and wisdom and I don't know what to do if you don't have an older parents myself or how I grew up or I have had very traditional so I can parents who is still a lot of Great Value thin me or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign I'm a Pisces but I'm really good with people just so you know. You know like I said I have my moments but I know if it's if it's something I could go into a developed I would do well really some of the situations or wish I would have waited to maybe have gotten married before I had children pick a different partner and I say that mean my son's father is great but a great father for my kids and I was too much as a partner for me we're not together we have been together in years but I'm just saying over Ross had I yeah I think I would say if I could let me backtrack that say not finishing school when I should have in my phone right my dreams and goals and doing things that's like animals planning initially and I think that's that would I honestly be the one thing I could say I regret is not following my goals and I'm finishing school on time and episode when I really want to do stay focus and finish school and pick a career path and stay on that and stay motivated and don't let anything or anybody to tell you I think I'm pretty stable and consistent just with overall thing come how I faced adversity house I face things you know I'm a pretty committed person I try to you know if I say I'm going to do something to try to stick to it I'm a very loyal friend and them are proud of the fact that I've maintained that a pretty good job of raising my kids so low okay great thank you bye bye okay with very gradually rising, very trembling, low, loud pitched voice",0
53,439,"okay you're welcomeI'm doing fine I'm from Los Angeles and born in Los Angeles yes you have a lot of places to go a lot of people to see love things to do smog the environment has changed over the years I've been around since 1952 and I was born here in Los Angeles and I see such changes as far as environmental with the smog and basically that's about it I'm sure you can tell them I've judged several places in the United States yes trying different type of Cuisines I like to go to museum like two historical or a historical buffer going somewhere different than where I've been here all my life I'll let me start with both try Boston I had never been to Boston before and when I went I was able to look at the Historical the buildings and I went to I saw the Lake Charles and then the boats and stuff with it it was just it was a good experience and it's another place I went to I took a ferry in it and my mind went on blank on it I can't even think of it right now but other than that New Orleans I didn't go to the Mardi Gras just I don't like to go when it tomorrow to growl when they have a lot of people I just went on the offseason I enjoyed that and I've been to Atlanta Georgia and I have taken a cruise went to the Caribbeans I took Mexico cruise by next cruise I like to go to the Alaska because I want to be able to see certain areas that we haven't destroyed yet as far as their Environmental I'm outgoing as far as going places I don't have a problem eating alone I don't have a problem meeting people I'm only shy and conversing back and forth to a stranger oh I have a favorite thing I like to go on the internet and I like to do sweepstakes I'm a person that loves to try to enter in a lot of contest and I've been very successful since I was a kid I've won a lot of sweepstakes and in the evening time I find our time and I just go online and just I'm so good at I know just about exactly the right time to even entering I usually try to answer them before midnight when everybody else is asleep so it's been successful for me getting married having my children I have a 27 year old son and I have a 31 year old son both of them when one of us married though it's not and I just not too long ago became a grandmother I have one grandson and my son he works for the County of Los Angeles assessor property conveyed convenience as amateur and the other one is the computer engineer So and I've been married for 33 years and strong you don't want if you build a foundation with your children and have a good relationship with them and talk to him and find out what's going on and tell them that you love them on my son I talk to him all the time when he went out the door I love you and even today when they're call me and hang up a said Mom I love you you always have to give them that that good feeling when they leave the door that you care and I never had to go to head to any jail to get them out they've been pretty obedient I mean boys will be boys but I never had any problem as far as them getting into any serious trouble and I'm very proud of that especially the boys I don't know how it would have been different but avoid if I have to say it was pretty obedient and they respect the law the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you and I've watched my son like I said just grandmother and I watch him how he handles his son and it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home on how the hell his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey I got a wife I have a son and it's my job to make sure that I keep a roof over their heads so it tastes off and I asked nicely he treats her well my mother was more Stricker on me but my parents for some unknown reason I guess because I have my sister and I were the girls like they weren't struck on the boys but they were more strict on the girls so they didn't let us go a lot of places and then my parents are so they weren't typed it like to travel and I used to look at them and say no I'm not going to be like that now I'm going to travel I'm not going to just stay home and I don't mean that is nothing wrong with him because they downtown love is home and do things at home but they never really travel anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one and I used to try to talk her and get on a plane and go somewhere and she said well I'm going to go here I'm going to go there but you never did she died she never needed to do any trouble so I made up for and want to do something different in the next two to travel more than and be more out there I was more of a social butterfly my mother was not a social butterfly so I made up for it I think before I speak and then I am the type of person also to take on other people's feelings before I blow out the wrong thing I try to analyze the situation first because sometimes you can put you open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you would not be able to get out of it's probably something about my husband yet I know it was this new construction that my husband is working on our house we had a disagreement on that then have their own way of doing things and I had told him not to use a certain person to work on our house but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead and now he sees all the downfalls and he didn't listen and so I didn't say I told you so but I guess you can tell by my facial expression that he'd have done wrong and I told him I said look you losing money and it became one problem after another so now I'll do a construction thing is up in the air right now cuz he knows he has done wrong and I'll but he doesn't want to face the fact that what he knows it but he doesn't want to really face it back so he says I look smart project with our project so I grabbed this one of the biggest arguments are we having right now that I can think of this recent I felt that he didn't really listen to me and he more so looked at cheap or economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways cuz I told him that you need to do your research I'm the type of person I do my research before I jump into something I asked tried to. My eyes and cross my T's but my husband he's not like that he's fight I can get this person can do this project for x amount of money and he's a good friend of mine so I don't care I mean is he license he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he could just jumps into it witch costumes some extra money unnecessary money that is spent on the end I mean it's a lot of money and so I was really very upset yesterday I was very upset about it because it was just wasted money that we could have say can we wind up doing the same thing all over again and it didn't make any sense I retired early I was very fortunate to retire at age 50 I retired in 2002 I was working for the State of California Disability Alice and what happened was I was able to reason why I was able to retire so early because I've been working since I was 18 and I had like 31 and 1/2 years of service and we was so nice about it that I only needed the best in like 10 years in my health insurance so I was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire I've been with kelp her and I know if you have a counter but if we have excellent retirement system and since I have been working with them so long I didn't get the full percentage I should have stayed Thomas 55 but I got out of that 50 and I didn't get the full amount but that's okay I found myself going back doing a little part time job because of the economical reason and then I have one eye that's so I think that was the kind of mistake I did I should have kind of waited till I was 55 and 50 but I look at it now as far as the health insurance I really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up and I don't pay very little money so I think that over the gates of the money that I receive you see the hardest I probably when my mom died cuz I'm not used to anybody dying and my mother died in 99 of non-hodgkin lymphoma and putting her funeral together my brother and sister we never we will never face with anybody dying of putting a funeral together and all response because I am the eldest it was put on me and I'm like oh my God what I do is so it's kind of like trying to find her insurance policy cuz I had asked her to make sure she put everything in order and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and try to get all the stuff together and finding things you know I myself I keep my things organized time for some unknown reason she didn't have her Sargon eyes and I think that was the hardest and knowing how much I have to pay cuz I had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff and I'm fortunate my mom this is interesting she had one of those small Barrel insurance but she had $1000000 of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with no accidents he had local conditions so that was something that we had to pay for the whole just about everything yeah it was it was but now I can handle that this is something weird but since that I've learned from that so I'm I have made it available for my children that my husband died we got together and we want him getting our insurance policy. Insurance policy but what do you call the Bureau Insurance be at that and it's just that we've had it for many many years so it's almost payday advances 10 years of pay for everything and everything and nothing that I did I've even written my own obituary I know that sounds weird so my son make one phone call that I don't want them to go through what I went through and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on and he said he don't want anybody to have any problem people I didn't tell him what to do it's already written we did a living trust it's nothing they can do but make one phone call and that's it I have no problem sleeping very well pretty good I didn't a little tired but that's only because the physical condition I have found out I have vitamin B deficiency in vitamin D deficiency self is more physical but not mental exercise walk walking more saw no not really no no I'm basically happy all the time I'm more so I'm making other people happy I get more phone calls as people want inspiration about things when they have projects they working on and then I try to encourage them and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey I really appreciate your input thanks and then they are I'll follow up on them and see how they're doing resource person I've been described as a resource person from my supervisor to from my friends because I'm the type of person I research everything I get into just about I just don't dive into any situation I tried to look up information some I know if we have the technology here that you can get everything on the end of that but I also go back to the old school like that like even finding this place I mean I did the map Google but also I love the Thomas brother I never going to give up my Thomas Brothers map Yellow Pages you be surprised I Don't Give Up by Yellow Pages so there's certain little things that I don't really let go I know we have technology sometimes she's going to be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff that even though technology get you have it right at your finger but you can find things and then they say I'm more Barbie first person the most people come to me just to just look up things and I get that that's as Funk about it because I like to look for stuff and find it and that gives me satisfaction I wish I could have stuff going up and down on my way to lose weight diet before the summer time and and then by Christmas time I have what they call a yo-yo weight problem and if I can stop binging and making food my friend I think that's it's a nervous disorder I did I like to eat and but also I don't like to be overweight either cuz I have plenty of beautiful clothes at home and I can't get them on right now so I know I saw them when we go on this bench and try to lose weight for the summer time so I can get a no so nice, so it's mostly not happy with my weight I'm sorry I didn't hear you no not really I was ready and I can stay skinny again back on I see you and I'll be home by 10 or 20 years ago I would have stayed a little bit more money before I retire instead of retiring too early what's Providence is on my life meeting a lot of people that came in my life I got good friends I still have 15 of the best friends that I went to elementary school and in very where you can find anybody who can walk around and say they have the same 15 group of friends we were in the sorority together went to college together lived in the same neighborhood and matter fact we just had with all of us and our 6-year birthday and our high school group we put together a 60-year birthday reunions and hear all fifteen of us with the exception of one we're all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so I think it's basically keeping the same friends I think we can probably outlive me okay you're welcome bye bye okay alrighty with very gradually rising, trembling, very low, very small pitched voice",0

skiing or to the beach may be in the same day I think probably the overcrowding and the smog I'm sure you can tell them not not frequently but I have meeting other people and learning about their environment and their cultures sure I'm the last trip I've taken outside of here was too heavily and that was my second time being there and I enjoyed it more this time because I knew what I wanted to say when I came back and and I was better prepared for Italians and their culturally I felt I wasn't isn't you know I was just better prepared I thought for that trip that would be being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house in the mist of acres and acres and Acres of grapes with just magnificent human development I actually didn't decide it first to do that I started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant and I went to a program in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant and through the process I learned that I had to do a long internship without pay and at the time and I miss I had a family so I had to make a career choice quickly and so the college offered human development major and I just went right in and used my use my units that I had already acquired towards that particular major in and I'm happy with it I'm currently no I stay at home I have a little one is not so little I'm preparing to go back to work in the meantime I design jewelry well I have three children I have almost four-year-old and then I have two older children 17 and 23 no that your children that the love from them and for them is unconditional all the stages that they go through their stages all the time for every age and everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages so I think I'm probably more in tune with those different stages that's why it makes me crazy and I think that my parents the time that my parents were parents he was just kind of like you know is she fed is she dressed as a house I mean a roof over her head and we're doing greatest parents and we love her and so it wasn't there wasn't too much I felt that that parents thought about in terms of n terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there's books for every age every year month you know and so I think it difference differs in that way tremendously fairy clothes outgoing I don't I don't feel uninhibited I feel you know confident to talk to people I probably talk more than I need to I bead I do I design jewelry that's what I do to relax I'm pretty good II well I think I trying not to not to feel or let others know what my emotions are when I'm upset which is not good because if I don't do anything with them then I know that some point it's going to come out and yeah that that's something I have to work on like exercising or something hey with my husband and it was about he asked me whether I thought about cheating ever in our marriage on him I really tired of talking about that same topic well it came it spawned from a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for many things and so he took that information and came home and decided to ask me if I ever thought about it and what made me I think about cheating and he knows that I've been resentful of him and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did I think about cheating and I we've had this conversation a lot of times and I mean not just that but I don't know just about cheating in general and so I just said what I normally said normally is that I haven't cheated in that I did think about that when we were first together and I thought it was just a mere thought and and then his response was I know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another and that just came out I guess irritated me I was really bothered by that and I just started liking you know we're having this conversation yet again and why are we having this conversation are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that that went into that argument I mean he wasn't yelling at me and was part conversation and part texting not talking at all pretty much any situation that involves my children and if I've yelled because I really don't like if I came to the point where I've had more of yelled it bothers me because I was yelled at a lot and I just feel bad about that and I try really hard to not handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset I might get and results and yelling tell me about the hardest that would probably be whether to keep a pregnancy or not yeah I am I was just talking about yesterday actually and I'll always pregnant and I had wanted I wasn't married yet and I had wanted to be married and but I just didn't think that it was the right time for me and I had pretty much made up my mind that I was not going to keep that pregnancy but I made the decision by myself and when my partner found discovered that I was pregnant he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me and so that decision was quite hard because I felt obligated to do so and felt super guilty to not and and earpiece Erica that was probably the hardest decision actually not know I wouldn't say that's the hardest decision I've ever had to make I'm sorry the hardest decision that I had to make in my life was whether or not the hospital should I unplug the life life support machine for my father or not that was our decision because I knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that and to have been to resort to the situation that he was in not capable of doing anything at all either speaking for himself was beyond who he was and I just couldn't see him like that anymore and he would be a vegetable I was told so I agreed to Amritsar. Not hardly ever too many things running in my mind and pretty much mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends even though I know that they're going to I mean I'm constantly worried about how they are when they come home and so I really can't fall asleep on the weekends most time but sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting good night sleep I'm just too exhausted I pass out but it's hard very stressed my son is is has been in dealing with some legal issues and currently is incarcerated and it's been really hard yes I've been probably very short Moody irritable well I often think about a lot of things that aren't even happy my mind just goes from when point A to point B and I don't even know how I got there now it's interesting yeah yes about 3 years ago my OBG suggested I I see a psychiatrist yes well I've in the process of changing therapist so it's been about because the program that I was in Lost funding and I lost my therapist. The therapist that I was working with and so it's been about two months maybe three now and but I did notice when I was in therapy. It was just an intricate part of my my life my week to see my therapist I really helped me cope when I picked up my son from when he was released from Gel I go get her probably you know should we use the term Hustler but meaning that I'll I'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to do what I need to do to support my family I mean you know legally of course outgoing maybe sometimes a little too for to outgoing for her and compassionate sensitive loyal all the things that remind me of my mother well yelling the yelling part was when just the little things that used to drive me so crazy I can see myself doing them and it bothers me a lot regarding what not too much really I don't know to go to college right after high school or not right and and that I didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy that are that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and not in a relationship and still be happy and live life what did I do I visit my son yesterday and that was really good I was happy that he was safe my children and my accomplishments in school and work bye purpavis tilted back and let came off okay maybe stopping it did not get got everything you needed with very gradually rising, very trembling, very low, loud pitched voice",1

I've gotten to the point where I know just to stop in and get myself out of there and then go take some deep breaths and then really try and figure out what I'm feeling why I'm being angry why why am I being so tense and then be able to verbalize that well it happens a few times when I start getting it had a very tense day and things haven't gone right I tend to have Outburst in the kitchen while I'm making dinner and the kids are all home and they're asking me questions about their homework or they're turning on the TV or and my husband's are bothering me about things that I just don't need to think about right then and one time I just said okay everyone out of the kitchen leave me alone get out just let me finish dinner and nobody would and I just it just had more pressure building up in building up and actually took one of the pots and just banged it against the stove really hard just like get people to pay attention to what I was saying and actually made a dent in my stove which is still there so that's that I should have walked out sooner and taking my deep breaths before I did that it was probably when I was pregnant with my first child I wasn't married I had a very good friends so I was I was 32 at the time so I was you know it wasn't young I think if I was younger I probably would have decided to have an abortion but at that point in my life I'm like okay I'm going to have this child and I had got pregnant by the man I actually married and still married to but we'd only been dating like 3 months and I was living with a good friend of mine who had been in the Peace Corps with and she in so I didn't know this guy very well I didn't know if we could raise a child together I didn't know if I wanted to get married and raise a child with somebody else and my friend suggested that we raise the child together even suggested moving to Costa Rica to raise the child together and so I was a lot of huge decisions that we're going to determine the rest of my life and I made the decision based on more common sense and practicality but I don't regret that decision I think I made a good decision to marry my husband and raise our child and they're older now my my oldest is 17 he is at DaVinci Science school and he's very much into engineering he is getting his pilot's license which I'm very proud of them for the my daughter is 15 and she loves acting she she has a boyfriend who they see just once a week at church basically and they text each other constantly she's a very very typical 15 year old and then I had a 12 year old he is extremely active and is in constant motion and always making noises but I love him dearly he is into rock climbing and there's a rock climbing gym near our house so he has a membership there so he goes over there and rock climbs almost on a daily basis no I find it extremely difficult I wasn't my mother had a varied if my dad died when I was young and my mother kind of disconnected when that happened so I didn't have a very warm or loving relationship with my mother or growing up and I basically raised myself I was kind of on my own from a very young age I mean she was at the house but really had no interaction with her so I really didn't have parenting skills that you know most people are are raised with I know what not to do but sometimes it's very difficult and I see my friends that has you know these very innate parenting skills is very warm and you know they're making cookies and everything's organic and they know everything and know their house is always perfect and it's like I'm just not that person so I I I Tried & B I think I am a very good mother but I'm not a typical mother I think I'm more and more creative a lot of times and we do a lot of things but it's not a warm fuzzy cozy kind of thing actually when we go camping it's more I'm more homey when I go camping then I am at home I think I'm more tense when I'm at home but I'm trying to factory meditation and things if that's what I'm trying to become calmer and more patient I think my patience is what I need to work on the most and they've been an insomniac all my life I remember as a child laying in my bed watching the stars go across the my bedroom window and I haven't slept well for a long time but I realize that if I exercise and I do something with my brain intellectually during the day I have to be physically tired and intellectually tired to sleep well and that's sometimes that's hard to do and so loud house I stayed stay awake beating I'll read till midnight and then I'll try and go to sleep and usually I don't get back up even if I wake up at 3 again and things of that sort. I'll try to go back to sleep yesterday I didn't feel so good I was I think a lot of it has to depend on the weather and was all cloudy and gray yesterday cuz I plan to when you're done working in my garden and then I'm making a butterfly garden in my front yard so I had some more planting to do and I just cooked in kind of feel like doing it so hard to put out about and wasted a lot of time yesterday but today I feel really good I feel more positive I feel more energy I don't know I just got a new mattress actually that hasn't really help me sleep but it was really good because I've needed one for a really long time and I was just kind of excited about being to get delivered in and set up and in that sounds like so mundane but it was you know just like I'm finally doing something positive cuz it's it's something that I put off doing and put off doing put off doing and it was like finally there in concrete and it's like I've done this task that I can check off my list but also I took the kids camping over on spring break and we just had a fabulous time and we sat around telling stories and around the campfire and making some more as and things like that and those kind of times make me very happy I don't know I think she believes that I'm more intellectual and smarter than I think that I am at times so she comes to me with a lot of issues she always she always listen to advice remains she thinks I give her good advice and when she doesn't know what to do so I shall ask me and then sometimes she just calls me to run things by just like to complain about because I'm sympathetic or empathetic and I just I'm just there to listen and I don't need to give her any advice so I think it's a good listener in I procrastinate a lot I start projects and I don't finish them so that's what I'm working on right now is finishing up a lot of projects that I started over the past few months a lot of them are really creative projects and I'm very enthusiastic about them when I when I start them and I'll get almost finished and then I don't know what happens I just completely lose interest sometimes I think it's because I'm afraid to finish them which sounds a little strange but I'm working on that to get this done oh gosh not following through on the opportunities I had when I got out of the Peace Corps there was a lot of things that I could go and try to go on to get my Master's Degree what are the grants and things so that's where it but instead I got pregnant got married and I had a wonderful job that I really liked and really enjoyed but then when I got pregnant the second time is right at a time where I had to fight for a directorship and I realized my limitations where I I couldn't be pregnant and have this child and and do everything I needed to do to get a directorship and so I really wish so I resigned and I wish I had stuck with that cuz then I would have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding in solid career not base decisions on emotions sometimes I am and not I have some really bad bosses the jobs were wonderful but my ego got in the way and I would have told myself to let go of that aspect of the job that goes the the egotistical reactions that I had to the bosses and concentrate on the job and doing that really well my children actually and also my Peace Corps experience was just phenomenal and people are actually really interesting that they were like an all that they actually know someone who actually did that so that that's why I always when I was a little girl my neighbor was one of the first people to go into the Peace Corps when it first started and I always said I want to do that one day I want to do that one day I want to do that one day and I finally got to the point where I don't have to shut up or do it so that's that was one of my powdered experiences okay thank you with very gradually rising, trembling, very low, very small pitched voice",0
59,445,"suffice a take off your top will she do it okay she's kind of hot that's my kind of woman alrighty then thank you yes I feel great I am from Los Angeles California the weather the opportunity and the ocean it's over crowded overpriced and somewhat dirty I have well it's nice to see other places in the world and to meet other people and cultures I worked on cruise ships as a musical Entertainer and traveled to Alaska the Aleutian Islands korea-japan and the Caribbean islands being in Galena Alaska and being on a small airplane and traveling in a snowstorm and surviving like I was on the edge of death and life but I lived the Arts and business I don't know I was attracted to the Arts at a young age and business went along with it are you happy yes yes to be able to entertain people and make them feel emotions and make enough money to have a comfortable life more outgoing I always feel feel very confident with my thoughts and I like people to know what I have to say I listen to music and I sit with my girlfriend and she calms me down when I'm stressed out I could work on that I'm not very good at that last night with my girlfriend she was asking my advice on something and as I was speaking to her she felt my tone of voice was too loud I was not angry but I was irritated that I was being told to quiet down when I didn't really want to help I just wanted to relax I agree sometimes when things don't go my way I get depressed or upset and I wish I could come down and just realized that I should count my blessings and look at the bright side of everything no matter how bad things get always look at the bright side that's my goal it's been very difficult but I'm working on it and it seems to be getting a little easier well I when I was taking care of my mother and she was dying of COPD and then it turned into lung cancer I chose not to tell her that her condition had worsened so she wouldn't be fearful and I had to sit knowing that her symptoms were getting worse but I couldn't tell her the truth and I let her think that everything was okay it was my mother being sick and dependent on oxygen for 3 years of me seeing her health declined that's what plagues me the most in my dreams and in my thoughts if I could erase that if that never happened I would feel better oh I don't know I try to be grateful I'm alive and try to focus on my own objectives and not dwell on the negative things of my memory my girlfriend she's a very good vibe positive influence she wants me to be a better person can you tell me about that she's since I met her she's been trying to make me not be angry to make me not feel negative and to be a nurturing positives in like man so what she's asking for is something that's going to make me and prove therefore I must capitulate how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep it's very easy I sleep well sometimes I wake up when I have nightmares about my mother or something but I go back to sleep that's unknown I don't know it just happens I've been feeling good as the my reality is I've been hit with a lot of financial problems but I'm handling them well actually I've been looking at it as my girlfriend is told me that I need to do this so therefore it is on the Forefront of my mind right now no no today when I woke up and it was a sunny beautiful day and I had a lot of goals to achieve and I'm achieving each one one by one it gives me a sense of accomplishment and happiness my ideal weekend would be playing music with my girlfriend is that something we enjoy to do at going out to a nice dinner of healthy food and maybe exercising and feeling good with my body and mind and spirit probably as a strong-willed person with a big heart but it has a short fuse and maybe complains about his own life too much what are some I wish I could not complain about negative things that happen and learn to roll with the punches and always look at the bright side tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about well one time I had a good friend tell me that one of the recordings I did he thought was horrible and I felt it was the best thing I've ever done so that and I would have don't understand how anybody could could feel that way and I didn't know if it was from jealousy or it was an honest evaluation so therefore I felt bad about that as it's my goal no nothing I regret I felt Channel 20 years ago I don't know well everything I do I enjoy it's hard to pick out one exact event that I really enjoyed I don't know how to put one above the other when things don't go my way and finances come down and I don't get jobs at I go for that I am qualified for but I feel like I'm not getting my fair chance and opportunity it's very frustrating I don't really feel guilty about things sometimes maybe if I'm angry and I shouldn't be that I feel guilty about that I don't ever want to be short with my girlfriend ever she'll wouldn't it doesn't deserve somebody using vulgar language or shouting or something so I don't want to be that way around her so therefore that I am guilty my achievements of my abilities to my music and my other abilities that I have and on my hard work has paid off and I'm very proud of those okay thank you goodbye I like her can I have her in my house to talk to me everyday I'm going to stop the recording so I have to say goodbye to him with very gradually rising, steady, high, small pitched voice",0
60,446,"okay thank you yes I'm wonderful how are you California yes the weather is one of them I have the food and the way I everything is centrally located the traffic the smog and it's just gotten really really overcrowded I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I wouldn't say a lot but I do try to travel at least once once or twice every two years just exploring different things and being able to have different experiences things of that nature and no learning new things and I'm just different cultures that I like to learn about different cultures and when you travel you get a sense of you no feedback from different cultures and different areas so I like that well I just came from Miami I last year I went to Miami for a week and a half it was really nice the weather was great it was my first time going and it was wonderful the people are really nice and it was really a great experience I went out there for a particular event they have something every year I'm where everyone comes out from all over and they just kind of party and hang out and meet new people was really fun well from that trip I would say swimming and the beautiful beautiful beautiful Miami Beach Waters was wonderful yeah it was child development well I've always been interested in children since I was younger my baby's had a lot so I had a lot of experience with kids at a young age and As I Grew Older I realize that it was something that I like to do so that's when I am looking to Child Development courses and I thought that it was something like that I wouldn't enjoy doing so I started taking classes and the rest of History I have gas it's been 15 years in August yeah my dream job I would say to become a principal what is something that I thought about doing for a while now and I've actually just began the steps to try to get that going so very back in school and I'm going to be taking courses I'm so that I can make that happen because it is a dream of mine thank you it's going to be pretty difficult there is several years of schooling that I have ahead of me and you know it's definitely going to be a challenge but it's something that I'm up for because it is a dream job of mine so it's something that I'm willing to I'm willing to do a little bit of both I think a little bit of both I can be shy at times in and out going as well but I think a little bit of both I would say what do you do I meditate I I'm a big big meditator so I love meditating I love just reading and just having nice quiet peaceful time oh wow I'm very very good at that very good at controlling my temper I again series of meditations that I do it involves deep breathing and just really censoring yourself to where you can feel your heartbeat and you can really feel everything in your body and it really really allows you to de-stress and to control anxiety and anger and things of that nature yeah that helps me a lot oh wow it was just recently actually unfortunately it was last week and it was with my husband and it was about just the way he responds sometimes to me I can be a little aggressive and we're just trying to work with that because I don't respond well to aggression I totally tune out and that's actually would happen so yeah that was it I felt very frustrated and I actually felt angered to but more frustrated and I felt fat and too because I don't like arguing so it was a little bit of all those emotions that one time the situation watch I wish I would have handled differently honestly I haven't had a situation like that and 20 years I've pretty much kind of you know kind of mastered more responses to certain stimuli I kind of got that down tell me about the hardest decision I've ever had to make while it was when I was 16 years old and I became a teenage mother I was pregnant at 16 and I had a lot of pressure from family to give my child up for adoption or to abort and I chose life so that was that was one of the hardest decisions is not the hardest decisions to make as a 16 year old teenage teenager just whether I wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager or whether I wanted to embark on raising a life when I was just a child myself so that I think was the hardest decision I had to make well I mean my son is almost 19 now so it's 19 years later and I actually am so glad it was one of the best things that I ever did by not choosing to avoid him and chew being pro-life pro-choice pro-life and and I have not regretted the decision that's my only child and I love him he is just a blessing he's just a blessing and I feel very special to be his mom I do oh yeah I know it's it's not easy it definitely has its difficulties I'm just as anything but at the end of the day it is really rewarding and you just get to see the life that you brought into the world and that you've raised become productive citizen and go out in society and start making their way and it's really rewarding it really is oh wow so many ways the first what are the first way is I actually listen to my son and I are accepted feedback even if I don't like it and I allow him to express his self fortunately unfortunately when I was little there was not a lot of conversation from parent to child it was more like we were just told you know what to do and we did it and with my son I give him options allow him to express itself allow him to give me feedback or negative or positive because I feel that it's really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age and that's parents you have to be supportive and that and kind of make sure that you nurture that because that's kind of the way that they develop me now and it's really really important so I'm different and I and a lot of ways and that right thank you well it depends sometimes it's it really depends it depends on the time that I go to sleep it depends on the time that I woke up so it's a lot of factors I can't just give you one answer I would say that it varies sometimes I can go to sleep and fall asleep right away and other times I can go to sleep and it might take a while to actually fall asleep so it varies I've been feeling great lately I've I really have been I can't say that work for the last week didn't affect me you know the argument with my husband but other than that I have been feeling really good no I haven't no I have not you know what honestly I feel happy everyday you know everyday I wake up I'm happy because that is a chance for me to take advantage Carpe Diem seize the day so I feel blessed every morning I wake up it's a blessing you know because I realize that some people did not wake up some people are homeless some people are going through so many situations that are really disheartening and that's not me so I feel really really blessed everyday thank you as nurturing patient loving friendly kind of reserved well I wish that I had already completed college and had my Master's Degree and sometimes I wish I was a little bit more knowledgeable and certain subjects and I can change that if I could change anything I would change that those two things and also I would be a little bit more outgoing and less of an introvert you know what no regrets no regrets you live and learn nothing is perfect everything that I've gone through has made me the person that I am today so I wouldn't change anything because I'm happy with the person that I am today oh man to stay in school to stay in school and to get your education and put that first and foremost before relationship even before your career I really really would have told myself to stay focused and to get a great education I'm most proud of where I come from as a Teenage mother being a statistic and actually changing that being on my same I've had my same job for 15 years now I'm really proud of that I've been married for 13 years I'm really proud of that happily married to my best friend of my soulmate and nothing is perfect but he's my best friend and I love them and I'm also proud of my son being the mother that I am in the Sun that I've raised I'm proud of the job but I've done and I'm I really applaud myself for that you're welcome you were wonderful thank you bye-bye hi okay with very gradually rising, trembling, low, very loud pitched voice",0
61,447,"yeah that's perfectly fineI'm feeling great it's an early morning I don't have school born and raised in Los Angeles California the fact that you can serve snowboard and like do to drastically different things in one day coming from the neighborhoods I've lived in I'd say the population of lower socio-economic backgrounds it's like a cesspool almost for young African-Americans and it sucks not really I've been to New York Connecticut Mexico and Texas but pretty young mostly if I'm traveling by plane just decide in the air is amazing it's remarkable the first time I went to New York I was about 11 years old and I made sure I got the the window seat on the plane and just a feeling of taking off is just exhilarating but we left at night here in LA and it was the next day in New York so it's kind of confusing getting used to the time change and the first thing I remember doing is getting a slice of New York Pizza it was it was delicious yep graduating with the bachelor's degree in Communications so I can go into the military as an officer what made you decide to do actually like would I don't know it's like you got to have a plan it's the only thing that's just falling into place and it seems like it's going to fall into place for me what's your dream job to be honest job that doesn't exist however you can get paid to do nothing yeah but probably I was definitely shy as a kid but I've grown into myself through the experience of college so I'm way more outspoken I write music and I work out mostly so if I'm feeling stressed out I just do a set of push-ups and lifting weights I'm pretty good I saw a therapist when I was a kid for about a year and I don't know if he told me to just be able to control my emotions and I don't think I do it in the best way because when I'm angry I do decide to like just bottled in my emotions instead of letting them out in their appropriate Outlets not really it's been more of a in interpersonal thing that's I don't know I don't know probably yesterday something in regards to sports the playoffs are on so things like that than Hu so many I guess in my senior year of high school I waited till the last minute to apply for the UC schools and it was unsuccessful because I didn't get to turn in applications and I'm pretty sure I would have been admitted so it sucks but hey tell me about that is an intriguing question I've actually no clue the death of my grandmother sure my grandmother died when I was 11 years old she raised me from the time I was born because my mother was unable to take care of me she raised my sister my brother and my cousin is well and her five children so she's the matriarch of our family and the closest thing I've had to a mother it was tough but it's going to be 7 years dismay next on the 30th and I've grown quite a bit No More Tears I'm a foster kid so I was emancipated from the Foster program about 2 years ago now but my immediate family are pretty close with him as much as I can and my foster family they're awesome I've known them since I was 5 so it's been pretty cool how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep fairly easy I fall asleep pretty quick it's not a problem except for when my back's hurting and then it's a problem a little moody in the morning I guess I drive more aggressively a little stressed about a few problems that I can take care of but I shouldn't stress because either can do something about it or I can't mess this way things work can you tell me about Usher I have a few parking ticket not parking tickets are not moving violations but their tickets and I was unaware of if you miss Court without being in the hospital or being in jail that you couldn't be excused from not been making your court date so I have 3 failure to appears in court with tickets that are thousands of dollars and I have no money so I don't know if it's pretty tough to deal with when you're trying to make something out of your life but there's so many barriers and obstacles that like you you didn't foresee so I don't know it gets stressful at times and yeah thinking about it for periods of times some days I just sit and I'm just lost in my thoughts and I don't really communicate to anyone because there's nothing anybody can do for me early so I just bottle it up like I do everything not very after doing it for so long it becomes a natural thing I believe no no really happy why is that such a difficult question I don't know I'm pretty content with everything right now I don't know about extreme happiness everyday is just the same day seems like dunking across the street at the Clippers center is a basketball court there and I've been working on it for a while and I finally got up yet I have 4 close friends that I've known for over eight years each and I don't know Studios hard-working determined I don't know yeah probably my metabolism which I don't really have control over some I don't know I'm pretty content with myself tell me about I think in my sixth grade year of grade school I was I wasn't the best of students but I had a teacher who was diligent and like he felt me the whole year but I learned a lot and I developed a passion for school afterwards so it was like a situation I overcome after feeling so bad and down the same teacher who made me feel really bad actually because it wasn't for his like sternness I don't think I would have gained the discipline to be where I am at now in college and stuff so I remember this time I was in the desert or up in Joshua Tree with my best friend and his dad and we actually got stuck in the mountains and like we went down a gully and his Jeep would get over a rock so it was it was pretty yes it was kind of weird and I thought I was Superman I try to move a rock that was thousands of pounds didn't work but yeah we eventually got out without going to be stuck in the desert but it was a fun time I got to drive in the desert when I didn't have my license owes fun about that day or in general other than like the UC thing like what I didn't apply to the schools and time I regret that I don't know I was I was 10 years old 10 years ago I probably say to myself no clue that's that's an interesting question Bing the first from my Mediacom immediate family is in my mother my brothers and my sister to go to college so yes it's pretty no problem with very gradually rising, steady, low, small pitched voice",0
62,448,"okay great thank youyes doing pretty good all I was born in Brooklyn New York I came out here when I was seven and I've been here ever since I don't consider myself anything but Oak California I'm a welder I just I don't know it was something about making and Building Things and repairing things that intrigue me and I was actually pretty good at it so I stuck with it and and that's my profession T I really never had that I've just kind of always hope that I would have a job that could support myself and my family and I was satisfied with that well I just recently lost my uncle and he raised me since I was 7 years old and other than my wife I don't have any more family he passed away last July and starting to get over it I knew the day would come but he was my last living relative so I've been depressed about that and I'll but I'm doing better it depends on the atmosphere if I'm around people that I don't feel comfortable with kind of reserved but if I'm comfortable and I feel like I fit in I'm not going screensaver right I enjoy old movies old while it's called film Noir and I love those old black-and-white movies and I get on Netflix or Amazon and I try to pick a movie that from back then people were different than day I don't know it's just a different era and I enjoy it my wife says I probably is not as good as I think I do but I've got to admit sometimes I lose my temper and it is according to her over things that I shouldn't be losing my temper about but I'm working on it and I have basically had this problem ever since I was young child oh yes I've been in and out of trouble with the law when I was much younger I'm past that point now but you know when you're young you think you know everything and you know you never going to get old and the future doesn't matter but it does matter because everything that you do when you're young follows you for the rest of your life and I don't regret things that I've done but if I could go back I definitely would make different choices me and my wife we we don't argue we disagree and it's she's very strong-willed and she's a match for me so we go back and forth but we don't get violent and we don't say meaningful things or hurt each other we're just she is a determined strong-willed woman and I am who I am so we kind of go back and forth and lately I have been the one to bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because in the long run it's just her and me and there's nobody else more important to me when I was younger I wish that I didn't follow some of the people that I followed and what I mean by that is no running in a circle with a certain people I am having an ego bigger than my common sense and that's what got me into trouble I was an only child and I kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and getting the girls to laugh or having people think I was going to cool or whatever you wouldn't think that now I'm kind of overweight involving but when I was in my twenties I was at a completely different person and if I would have had some brothers and sisters I may not have thought or acted that way but I was an only child so I you know where and we're people thought I was cool and that got me into trouble tell me about the hardest decision I've ever had to hardest decision I ever had to make was giving the authorization to have my uncle passed away he was on life support and his kidneys have failed and doctor said there's nothing more I could do and to not have him go through any suffering to let him slip away Michigan see I get very upset my uncle raised me like his own son and never let me down and he's gone and for lack of a better word to push the button I never thought I would have to do that but as I said I'm getting over it and things are getting better slowly my wife she is always there for me she will always surprise me we she's not my wife she's my best friend and she knows me better than I know myself we enjoy doing simple things it's not that we can't do other things if we wanted to but we mesh we enjoy each other's company we like the same things and we you know occasionally go out and do something together but we we just enjoy each other's company and she like I say knows me better than anybody in the enzyme it surprised me sometimes how is your day you know lately when I can't say lately if I don't excuse me if I don't do a rigorous activity or something that really stresses me or strained my body at let's say for a couple of days I'm just very relaxed and not doing much I just automatically get up after 4 and 1/2 5 hours I mean En Mi y physician now that you're not getting any sleep but I mean I don't feel tired I don't feel so exhausted I don't feel like I need to go back to sleep I'll stay up all day and I'm fine and most people will say that's not enough sleep but you know for me it doesn't affect me well it was some things could be different but I'm not dissatisfied I'm happy with my life that they're like with anybody else there's a few things that I wish would different and I think that's an anybody everybody else has no life but I'm content yeah I feel a little less motivated recently well I can't say recently this was back in January my wife and a few friends were noticing that I was becoming forgetful and I couldn't remember things I didn't see it and you know when they wouldn't everybody brought it to my attention then I started to anyway I went to the doctor and they gave me the test and apparently I have MCI which is mild cognitive impairment and I've over the last month or so nobody has mentioned it to me I'm a man maybe I'm getting better but the neurologist that I saw us as having me come back in a year and going to retest me hopefully it's not the beginning stages of Alzheimer's I'm still a little young for that I'm away from 52 but I was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and it could have been due also I was told by him because of the death of my uncle I could have been very depressed and I was not able to retain things and tell work I'm going back in a year and we'll see if I'm any better I'm sorry I'm not understanding you I'm sorry no no I have not yes 2001 I was in a what is the word I'm looking for I was in a in a state of mind of where I was just going to get myself in trouble and and not benefit anything if I didn't seek any help I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder Waring and thinking too much about things and thinking the worst and I I take medication for that well you know it's not really therapy it's you know every few months you know you got to see the doctor are you doing fine everything good and you know they just refill your prescription it's in alphabet you know kind of like the next person next person that is I am with Kaiser so it sits they'll talk to you but it did they give you the impression that you know I okay let's move along you know that they'll hear your explanation but you know they don't have all the time for you that you may want so I'm doing fine now if I really needed help I would I would do something the medication works for me last time I felt real happy well it would depend on what the event is I'm always happy when I'm doing something with me and my wife and we're enjoying each other and I ain't no I'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and I don't have anything else she is my world but I enjoy being with her and we we we do things together and I'm happy all the time when when we're doing that when I'm outside of that Circle I don't know if the sounds right but I'm not seeking happiness I I can only explain it as I'm content I'm not I'm not disappointed or I'm not wanting anything I'm being whatever comes my way is fine so well I don't know why I couldn't give you that answer I want my best friend is my wife but she would describe me is I don't think before I speak I let the littlest insignificant things bother me and I get angry over but the big things it's like I let it go and she's bewildered by that years and years ago she had a classic Pontiac LeMans and she had got into a minor fender-bender and she thought it was going to be the end of the world cuz that was my baby and I don't worry we'll get it fixed and she what she thought was going to hang or something this was as you know it was my baby and she calls you know you you get excited over nothing but you know I ate something like wrecking your car that you love and he put so many hours of work into it money it all gets crashed and it's like you don't care so that's the only way I can explain it well I need to lose some weight if you could say I'm definitely been on the eating beans and the neurologist said that's probably due to the event with my uncle I'm here I am this is the heaviest ever been in my life and I'm finding it a little bit harder I can't say harder but I'm finding the willpower just say no and stick with it and to go exercise or not you no movement now Gourmet before walking on me and my wife and we were a little bit younger we used to love going for walks and we lived in a hey boy you don't look at that wonder what's inside their ER at that's the way that we don't do that no more I guess it's worth a little bit older now and trouble heavy retarded to walk with all this weight but I I I wish I could change that because this is not a healthy size lately no I don't regret anything lately everything's been fine the I could say that the biggest biggest impact in my life was the event with my uncle and I never ever in a hundred years there ever thought that I would face that situation and I'll never forget it but they say time heals all wounds and and it does don't listen to other people again I'm not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened but he used to constantly tell me to he would see the things that I was doing in the pads that I was going down and I constantly thought I knew better and I think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they the young lady that I was talking to in here they think they're invincible and so did I I figured I'd never going to God I'm never going to have those problems I wish I could have changed some things the history of my past follows me as it does everybody and that has limited me and in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that I'm able to do I don't miss them but if I could go back 10 or 20 years I definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions I made my welding certificates I'm certified by the American Welding Society and I have that's probably the biggest achievement that I made for you know myself an accomplishment people that I know say that I'm well I haven't been working on cars lately but they said that I have a natural knack for restoration and working on vehicles and I don't see it but I've been told that once or twice but I I've kind of I've kind of started to slip away from that I don't know why I can't say from lack of interest but I just don't feel the motivation no more I wish I had a pocket of money and I have somebody else to it that's how I feel okay well thank you bye-bye hey okay well I'll tell you know after a couple of minutes with very gradually rising, steady, low, very small pitched voice",1
63,449,"thank you hi okay yes I am I'm good thank you originally from Los Angeles and my parents are from Central America yes the weather I like that I can get to the water if I want to go to the hills or hike or just any element that want to get to I can get you traffic busyness everybody's always in a hurry that's about it I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer you travel a lot when I can I have family in Central America and when I can my husband and I we try to go to warm places like Mexico or somewhere in the Caribbean the freedom of not having to have my daily routine and not be guilty about not doing something I said I would do if I'm at home and if I'm too far away from home to do it then I don't have anything to worry about recently I went to Honduras again that's where my family is from so sore like a it's a dual fault I get to see my family but also kind of get to be away from home so I do it by not imposing on them I visit them but I stay in a hotel so that way I can still kind of have my freedom and not feel like I'm obligated to being with them so it's more fun that way experiences on vacation or experience probably Hawaii in Lahaina and just having enough food I'm a foodie so having the pig roast it on the ground and just eating it that way it's just I've never been able to taste it that way anytime else so it's like a very memory is a deep memory for me cuz no matter what I do to my porchetta never taste like that pork in Lahaina business and that was years ago so I ended up in the marketing field so I've enjoyed I'd my business background did help me in the marketing field my dream job well I guess it would have to do with food I love to cook and only reason I hesitated because I love to cook but I just do it for home and friends and family if I were to turn into in if it would have turned into a job I feel as if it was just not be as joyous or I wouldn't have as much fun as I do have it you know what I have now but if I could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that I have in cooking everyday now then that would be my dream job I'm not going depends on where I'm at if I'm wherever I'm at actually the first thing to do is just going to get a hold of myself that way I'm always in control no matter where I'm standing at and always say that I am my own piece p a p e a c e so I just kind of just take a deep breath assess my situation figure out what I can control what I can't control and then proceed from there but just sort of just kind of breathing get a hold of myself first I'm actually very good I'm actually very mild temper to begin with I don't really let anything agitate me and so if I do feel myself is getting hot or if I just react I just told her just like I said just do my own little self check you know I'm not a customer went off for a second but I do my own little self check and just so you know what come on now it's not worth it this person is not worth it the situation is not worth it be who you are and just stay there introducing my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and I was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kind of overlooking my feelings in it and I was I didn't want him to overlook my feelings and act as if I wasn't feeling the way I was feeling so I kept stressing my point in different ways and I found myself now in a debate and then that's when I pull back and said not look babe this is how I feel about it I'm not asking you to make me feel any differently I'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings when I got to my own conclusion I felt triumphant because the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how I felt not for him to impose his you know he's very Macho kind of manly guy I don't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic and so I said no as long as I have felt better because I eat I feel understood and I felt heard I get my son comes to mind he's 22 years old and he we have a very strange relationship right now and it's okay I'm okay with it is used to be be a little bit more needy so he I think he assumed that I would just always look cook go looking for him or call for him as opposed to waiting for him to call me and I think I may be a very weird answer but I wish early on in my life as his mother I would have kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come and check on him he doesn't live with me he has his own place but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know I'll try to make sure that he's okay I think it's probably way more than you met but I would have thought would have done that different I would have mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that I would have treated him more of an adult and then also not expected him to just kind of you know I would have to kill the expectation in him for me to Contour see him if that makes sense I know it's not easy you have to sacrifice and Beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kids needs ahead of your own and I guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay you're okay so my son and my daughter they both know I love them unconditionally so my parents and has become easier the more and more I've lived in that true for I'm not expecting anything from them but then I also not expecting any disrespect so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect seeing them maybe make decisions that I wish they wouldn't make it could be as simple as an outfit no choice or as much as a career change but having to sit back and watch them listen to be open and then just kind of just be there in only want to talk about it but then not also also try not to manage them because I was also their age and have to remember that I didn't want to be managed and even if I made a mistake I don't want to be judged so the difficult part is watching them go through the process on their own and just sort of kind of just waiting around and luckily something major with my kids but whatever that personal downfall is just kind of being there and not having an I told you I told you so Spirit on me Shuffle feeling knowing that you know I created this and all I plan both my kids so it's just it's a real it's an honor that I was able to do it as an honor that they're healthy and it's fun watching them so just kind of grow into their own and it's like they're minimis but then they're all so different than I am and so it's fun just being able to allow them be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so I'm enjoying that wow completely my parents immigrated here from Central America in the 60s I was born the year after they got here so they're their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the American lifestyle and which was not a bad thing is it that their parenting style was more about making sure we had a home making sure we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter so I had to kind of figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had divorcing my first husband cuz I was going to be the one that toppled that whole situation he was a good father just not a good husband to me and after 20 years I knew that I was going to be the one to say this is not working for me anymore and since I did that the domino effect was is this is not virtual it happened we ended up selling our house you know dividing up the assets and then living separately and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while and then I just made some decisions to where I didn't want to go through so much Court hassle so I just did a Tina Turner and said just give you my name you keep everything else so it was a very hard decision by way of how it affected my kids that's all I cared about in terms of losing everything physical and and all the material stuff I could care less but it was hard because I I knew it was going to affect my kids and they were the only thing I was concerned about my husband and I did not you know see eye-to-eye on certain things United regarding our marriage heat I didn't feel validated as a woman or as a wife and that's just who I am and those are the very areas that he didn't validate me and he just kind of saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extra-curricular is where there was his travel or or whatever the case maybe I'm not I'm not here to talk about that part of it bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home and I was tired of just you know working and and him benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he wasn't prepared to change the despite all the counseling went through and I thought well this is not working for me and I have to take care of myself first and I had low self-esteem I mean I wasn't perfect I had a lot of things going on with myself and I had to learn how to love myself and I were to die in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the dog that I should get in return how is your day you know what is actually pretty easy because of the end of the day I just you know good bad ugly or indifferent whatever mistakes I'm happy that day or whatever great thing went on that day my goal in life is just to have peace of mind so when I put my head down at night I just ask myself didn't you know that I do anything but I'm ashamed of today that I cross anybody that I not do you know and I'm not being a Pollyanna but I believe in karma I'm a God-fearing woman so I just want to make sure that I did everything I'm supposed to do today and if there's something I can Rectify it you know I just make it a point to promise to myself to go back and rectified or at least learn from that and just not make the same mistake in another day really good light you don't have to rough patches with the family individually like I said with my son my daughter the teenagers so she's kind of coming into her own so that's a different relationship to the opposite of me I'm actually very easy going very Bohemian style she's very social very it'll just out there so I'm having to just kind of find our balance but overall it's just I won't complain I'm very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle that I just kind of foster on my own every day and I just enjoy my little mini accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not no I haven't thanked God no really happy to see that's at home and I think it was when different things running through my head I think with my daughter and I my teenage daughter and I came to understand understanding on our mother daughter relationship I'm not trying to be her best friend but yet doesn't mean you can't talk to me and I think when she came to me the other day just going to give me a big hug from behind me without really saying anything I really felt her just accepting herself and she accepted the fact that I accept who she is as she is so it was a very same moment I only see and I kind of knew about it but it just gave me just a happiness it nothing else could ever give me thank you I'm easy going I'm fine I'm just very you know a chameleon comes to mind I just kind of acclimate to It Whatever situation I'm in I'm very honest I'm very real and just you know old if I have to be I'm just very adult I'm an adult woman and you know they were just described my best friend would describe me as someone that she can rely on extremely reliable I do as I say I say what I do and I just you know I don't I don't deal with BF how to change about myself probably cosmetic things maybe I would just sounds weird that I was saying nothing nothing really I think I would just be a little bit more aware of others I think I'm super sensitive to others but I think I would just be more aware make sure that I'm not being selfish or I'm not turning anyone out just because I want to get through my yoga I want to do something else I think I would just be more observant and aware of those around me to make sure I'm not offending anybody I don't have any regrets that I think about that all the time and you know this is natural to go back and say if I were in that situation with the mindset I have now what would I do it but the reality is that I know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me so I can't you know very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret because I know I learned from it probably sounds very textbook but that's true that's is really how I live so I believe that everything good bad ugly or indifferent happen for a reason I truly believe that and my job is to take from it what I'm supposed to take from it and take that into my future so I'm to take the you know the Hard Knocks with it with the joys be real with myself that's that's one thing that took me 20 years to kind of get to just to kind of be honest with myself to embrace who I am to just you don't get to know who I am learn my own infrastructure be comfortable with the with the innate things that are a part of me don't try to read. I read that myself or try to become something that I'm not I would have still chosen the same marketing career to see if I would have still climb the same corporate ladders but I would have done it from a more internal place not that I lost myself in it but when in terms of my family life I would have just been more true to myself and that way I would have had any kind of resentments my family my my role as a wife my role as a mother I think that ultimately that's where my main fulfillment comes from because no matter what at the end of this life this life of in this body and this vehicle. I mean I'm going to do or I'm going to be as an Epitaph and somewhere in a cemetery and I'm always just true to that I mean I've been always true to that from the time I Was Eighteen and realize I wanted to be married and have a family and kids and all that I think that ultimately that that's where my true fulfillment comes from thank you bye that's cool that's cool okie dokie with very gradually rising, trembling, low, very small pitched voice",0

I don't talk we don't talk and it's sad excuse me can you repeat that wowed house if my father was a positive influence he was a really genuine man honest funny handsome I have a business owner a businessman that I work for who was it extremely positive influence at least in my professional life I've had a counselor at UCLA who was totally I think of her often and some of the little things that she said to me keep me going in my life now trust the process she told me to trust the process and when people are having trouble and I'm having trouble I take it step back and say you know just trust the process it it it all works out the way it's supposed to be I'm just one more positive influence that I knew in Hawaii that taught me a friend of mine that lives on Kawaii that taught me how to enjoy nature and taught me how to fish and and I love her a lot too great positive influence healthy healthy influence it's not I have back problems so it's hard to sleep at night and I wake up in the middle of the night sort of stretching and straightening out my back I have a back issue that sometimes more often than not keeps me from sleeping good that's okay I'm dealing with it I'm a little depressed I've been a little depressed I haven't been working as much and I you know I have pain in the mornings and in the evening I have pain throughout the day and night with my back and it's just a little depressing you know I get depressed all so you know just thinking about my business that I sold and you know where I would have been if I hadn't of done that and a general feeling of I've been a little depressed over the past couple of years actually yes well I've been diagnosed many many years ago and I guess depression stays with you although it gets treated and I was diagnosed about two years ago I think I don't know what to ask me that on the questionnaire as well and I sought treatment for it and then my insurance ran out and the prescriptions I couldn't put the do my prescriptions anymore but now I'm back on medication and so I take medication for my depression therapy absolutely I love therapy wow that's huge confidence and self confidence in myself confidence in my decision-making a general feeling of overall content a sounding board you know when I have stuff that's bothering me that I can't go to the I feel that I can't go to the person with I can go to my therapist in a lot of times the issue is resolved there it wasn't a big issue or I work through it or the therapist through the therapist allowed me to look at a different way of looking at the situation and in that way I find therapy to be invaluable actually I believe so yes I was I believe it was and he was told to me by a psychiatrist that that's what I was that's what I was having and this was within the last five years I think it was looking back now what are we 2013 it was 2009 so 4 years ago I'm not able to deal with like Shell Shocked not able to deal with anything irritable on the phone I mean just just anything would get me to fly off the handle and I'm just not able just shell-shocked and not hiding it my in my house not opening mail not being able to concentrate not being able to deal with with things that were that I felt were will that were bombarding me I felt overcome and the psychiatrist said that it was supposed to matter stress disorder butts and I was given some medication which I stayed on for a year or so or so and I don't know through Psychiatry and therapist and medication I was able to come out of my shell a little bit about a week ago I was on a hike and up in Malibu and at this beautiful Labrinth that looked over the Pacific Ocean and I was with a friend and we were having lunch and I lay down in the grass and took a nap and I felt content I was happy at that moment at that moment that time a week ago honest sincere smart caring smart good question I'd have to think about that yeah I have regrets in life and everything works out so you know if I could change the past I would have never dropped out of school when I did a long time ago I mean I've since gone back and completed lots of stuff I probably would have gone into the military I think I was going to do that in my early twenties I'm 55 now I sort of regret not doing that at that time I regret selling my business I regret of course I can't control this but I regret that my father died when I was so young and he never really got to know me and I never really got to know him I regret I regret not seeing my grandmother enough before she passed away I regret I mean those are the things that I can think of right now not putting away for retirement I regret when I had the money to do it yeah I mean just here that's what I would say stick with it just stick with it because in order to get out you have to go through and I when it comes to fear or flight I get the fear and I flight so sometimes you just have to sit in fear and then everything works out wow I'm

65,451,"okay thank you and please are you okay yes okay other than this laryngitis I have a Cleveland Ohio in 79 I think it was once a year or something like that or less there's a lot more to do here they're a little more narrow-minded back there and Republican well originally Show Business but probably to get away from Cleveland it was very difficult at first I'm not used to change I don't like change very much you know having to meet new people and figure out how to make a living well I like the different opportunities you have the different the health Consciousness the movies the variety of things you can do the places you can go the weather the driving the congestion some of the superficial attitude the importance well not a lot but I do I just came back from Vegas to visit relatives we met there and I'm going to Mexico next month well seeing the different cultures like I've been to Europe Greece France Italy I like going to places such as Mexico or it's going to be sunny and just lying out I went to last year I went to Arizona and ever saw Sedona that was really an experience peaceful about Sedona yep well Sedona is a very energetic place and I thought it was Desert like flat kind of desert looking but it was very Rocky and when you land in Flagstaff there's these beautiful pine trees and the elevation is high and then coming into the doughnut was very beautiful and and after a day the pain in my back went away that I had there for months so anyhow this even though we went to bed late and got up early you had the energy so is really very mystical in life or incident in life well being on stage in Boston and that was great I love doing that just being with friends and laughing some of my highest moments when we were laughing hysterically well I don't know if a particular situation but when I when I decorate for special events and I worked with somebody on a regular basis and we would just find humor in everything and just laughing and I can't think of particular situation or what we were laughing at but just being with somebody who's in tune with my sense of humor and gets my jokes and you know I get his and we're just enjoying that moment speech and drama I am a traitor oh no not now I always was interested in musical comedy when I was a child I would sing along to records in my living room and I was always inquires in school and then when I went to HighSchool I join the drama club and I just always had an interest and I always had a big personality and well I don't know if I have a dream job anymore I'm 60 and I don't know if I have aspirations anymore to towards doing anything right now I just rather not work in chest relax and travel but I like being creative and in any way I can I like Independence and I kind of have that right now so I'm okay I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got well I I watched my favorite television shows that I've recorded and I also am a Buddhist I've been a Buddhist for gosh since 1988 and I'm at District leader in my community and we have meetings and that really helps to Center me and bring out my higher self so if I get tense or nervous I I chant sometimes okay sometimes not a lot yes yes less and less though it's been happening less and less but yeah sometimes it's got its hit some created difficulties well I can't remember an argument I remember getting angry like was just when I was on my trip in Vegas I was driving and the GPS said stay in the left lane and I stayed in the left lane but when I get off the freeway it brought me onto the ramp that went back onto the freeway about 4 miles out of our way and I just I got very angry for about 30 seconds and then I had to call myself down and say okay alright so we're going to be late and I had to talk myself out of it so it wasn't really an argument with anybody but I felt kind of bad that I overreacted you mean in my life many's yes Ashley so many I just wish that when somebody tells me disappointing information like they're not going to use me on a job or something that I would take an attitude that I'll find something better it's okay and move on as opposed to feeling what's wrong with me and you know did I do something wrong and then get angry at the Hammond you know that whole thought process that really doesn't help the situation can I do that more often but I since I started chanting but it doesn't you know I'm not always in my highlights get to where I can do that I find a lot of situations to talk to me like you know what television to buy yours but I guess the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences and or leaving my comfort place if the decision meant that I had to leave my comfort place that would be a very difficult decision for me and probably leaving a relationship very hard because it your I get dependent on that relationship so I usually live it out until that's for it. It's believed or something and it's very hard for me to make that decision that this isn't right and I have to move on so what I usually do is I don't make the decision and I end up suffering with longer cell can we move on how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep well it's hard because I don't know if it's because I have pain in my back and neck but it's difficult for me to stay asleep I I don't get it a deep sleep but because of it so it's hard to say because right now I have this cold and I've had it for 2 weeks so I've been taking Nyquil and that's been putting me to sleep so I have been sleeping better because of it but last night I had woke up coughing so it's it's hard to tell but before that all happened I was finding it difficult to stay asleep and so therefore I'm tired during the day and sometimes I'm groggy sometimes I'm irritable but I'm not really sure if it's related to this pain in my back or emotional things are or are not I'm sorry could you repeat that have I studied changes in my behavior no I was not no oh why I was like happy last week you know can you tell me about the well I was going to Vegas to meet my family with my my family is flying in from Cleveland to there we have a relative in Vegas and I drove with my friend and it was my brother-in-law 70th birthday so we all went and had a good time in Vegas and I was struggling through my cold but but it was fun it was nice well are they think I'm funny they feel that I say it like it is then they all say they understand me so people who don't understand me I think sometimes don't know how to take me cuz I'll I'll say something sometimes it come up come across sarcastic but that's just the way I talk so my the anger that sometimes Wells up in me you know I just but although that that really made me I think a lot of the person that I am you know all the all of your experiences make you who you are and how you handle them makes you who you are and if you don't have those Lowe's you don't really know what hyzaar so I don't I can't really go back and regret and I wish certain things didn't happen whatever but really what matters is today and now and how you handled today and I wish that well I can't I don't wish I know that I will have less of these moments where I just burned out you know anger or something I just wish that would happen more or less that anger Parts what happened less and they are so I guess it will having less don't give up hope live in the moment and everything will everything will work out everything will work out and if you believe that then you really have nothing to fear the fact that now and for the past 20 years 20 some years I've been cultivating myself and I've been I've become a more compassionate person and I'm able to understand people better and see that you know they're they're suffering too and that if you if you treat people from that respect if they're they have their problems too and they're suffering with their problems to you able to live a better life because you're not allowing that to affect you if you're not taking it personally and at the same time you're becoming more compassionate person and when you're more compassionate you're you're happy and your life is happy okay with very gradually rising, trembling, low, very small pitched voice",0

About other people besides myself I studied massage therapy and Nursing degree a lot of it's just been on job education I'm very I'll get to my own injuries I just going through the therapy process and believing in people and seeing how it worked and I decided to do that I wanted to help people too are you happy oh yeah yes I want to paint that's all I want to do is just paint I have two sons and it's time for me to the move on and they're older and they can take care of themselves now so many leaving the area where my sons are sweetheart the reflection of you play reflection of you a mind you so much about yourself Who You Are consistency even when you're sick I don't assume my kids are right around by listen to him first and then make my decisions after that and I try not to come from an emotional hiding place but I think logically and I put myself in their place before I do it we discuss we communicate happy in my family cuz that's the only way we get along with each other through communication communicate my family is severed pretty much so my family my relationship with my family on the reservation is very tight and the rest of the family were all fragmented scattered around the Southwest so it's not very tight at all I have too many to count start with my uncle my uncle was like my dad. Me to go away he watched out for me he told me he taught me hard work at a very young age he also taught me to protect my family Tommy honor. Me Love it's a good man how easy is it for you to get a good night I don't lie ever had a good night sleep in years so I have to get broken sleep are dreams the dreams you come through real get up and go to the bathroom and go back to sleep my years of fighting and just got up to me reserved reserved and I try to find things to distract my brain to think of different ways of doing things I got rid of TV about 8 months ago so I got rid of that distraction so what I do now is ready to paint a garden or cleaning house washing dishes or get out the walk that's nothing to do a lot of walking out is anxiety anxious my anxieties habits good I have techniques to bring myself down nothing new out of the normal yes 3 years ago around 3 insomnia issues it was about 2 years ago around there to look it over two years ago I was released from therapy off the therapist Release Me what I noticed is I still deal with pictures and emotions what would I do is now if I really practice hard at taking care of myself and then getting to those places to things that strike me give me anxious or excited or angry I learn how to work out of it and realize it's not real it's not real that's just the emotion it's not real so these are the things like no manches and I tell myself and this is really helped me a lot from therapy because it taught me that those emotions and pictures truly aren't real and that's the therapies helped a lot that mean it's just a change my world if around the same time as the PTSD after years ago in my dreams when I dream I do last night I just dreaming of fighting and then in preparing fighters to fight I wasn't nothing to I build up anxiety dreaming about preparing fighters to fight and then stepping in front of thousands of people and then I always end up fighting in my dreams so it's always what gets me scared in all my dreams is that I should have made the move and finish the fight and I didn't and so builds anxiety and stressing me that I tend to act out in my sleep I was real like I was there right like I smell taste feel everything their house there on this morning driving here talking to my girlfriend trustworthy he loves me I love him he's more best friends a 02 change I can recall okay I got it just not spending time with my grandparents and in I think they today issues maybe you know a couple here there that I should have went to the store first or something like that but I mean it's nothing like that quit thinking you know it all my loyalty my trustworthiness the new art project yesterday nice where is Santa Barbara from the film some rocks and some old rock song Someone that made by loving just threw a dump old rocks out of the way and it went through the pile of rocks and I found the soul rock that was in the middle of it and then took a home and now I'm doing art piece on it and for me it was like the thing was totally forgotten about was just considered a rock and now they're sure you'll be sitting in my grand kids table and let's just give me a call like that what are you most proud of in your life start starting something that I'm so bad at then I don't think there's no way I can be good at it and all sudden I get to be better at it so I don't even have to think about it just so good at it that way I could just touch it and feel it and then I think about it these are the things I'm proud of like I like that I like that accomplishment I guess you can say her her left clavicle needs adjustment her clavicle set tired makes it look like she's been in a car accident and she's like this sheet her left shoulder is up higher and it's question so you're off and it's drawing my attention to that so I don't know if you guys noticed that to the other part of it too is the hand motions that she does some of the hand motions are very aggressive in it and wakes it was very distracting in the beginning because she was like fast moving like my therapist cuz we working with the PTSD issues he that he did everything slowly cuz I said off on quick trigger movements and so like with her hand movements like that. Like this talkin it was distracting in the beginning but besides that everything is just like it's pretty amazing computer but it's and you feel comfortable that is a good thing yeah yeah with very gradually rising, very steady, very high, loud pitched voice",1

70,456,"okay occasion yes and well thank you Boston Massachusetts I moved to LA about a year after graduating college in 2001 quite often least a couple times a year God I love both cities they are polar opposite in many many ways but there's things about both of them that I love I have to pursue acting and writing it's still not complete reality to me but it was actually very easy because of the the the the creative factor out here allowed me to pursue what I wanted to creatively and there's different the social culture was different in a way we're at from where I had grown up and it it suited me better my personality I like the fact that you can come here and pursue any any niche of in creativity or art or entertainment that you want to and sort of make your own path I grew up where its nose constantly and is very very cold so sounds obvious but clearly I like that it's you can swim year-round and I like that it's there's always something to do no matter what day of the week it is I don't like well I miss my Sam I miss that there's no I don't like that there's not a big family element here I miss I'm a big family girl I miss my family I feel like it's very crowded here but yet it's very easy to feel sort of isolated alone here I'm sure you can I can't see you she is but I do mostly just not up to much worldly travel mostly back to Boston and Florida where my parents live but I do enjoy traveling and take a lot of trips within California and around here I just have an adventure do something fun or if I'm going home it means I want to see my family oh my god well I like to drive up to Northern California go to San Francisco and family and friends they're always super super fun. In college I with my college boyfriend from Boston to eat we drove we went to San Francisco and drove down to LA and Las Vegas and that was kind of how I realize I wanted to move here so that was very that was ready I was a big one in general I guess it would be moving here I move to when I move to LA I got on a plane with didn't know anybody here and I just got I talk to a girl and I met online and agreed to be her roommate and she pick me up at the airport we never met and you know one of my dear friends to this day so definitely don't deflate out here was his big monumental I felt powerful and excited and just open to whatever telecommunications got a lots of every lot of different writing writing styles eventually graduated with a concentration in public relations and English minor what made you decide to do writing cursive writing writer of I guess you could say writer-actress which is but I guess writing is first hard very hard because you need to know he's going to push you to do what you have to be self starter you have to make it happen so it's very hard cuz I don't think that's that naturally in my personality I do but not as much as I need to I would say are going on in general pink screensaver I sometimes take a walk if I feel tense listen ambient music helps if I need a soothing background white noise calming, area and just it's your basic depressed and just sort of take a minute to come back to it, Mitchell place I am getting better at controlling my temper cuz I don't usually have a temper too often but when I do and I lose my cool I have a hard time controlling it yes no argue with someone God I guess it was a friend a friend a girlfriend if it wasn't it was about our are each separate perspectives on a a certain situation between us but obviously very very different and it started out as something big and then we just realized this is this is stupid we don't need to be fighting about this so it kind of ended quickly I guess it would have been with an ex-boyfriend fighting with an ex-boyfriend relationship stuff definitely losing my temper and making a situation escalated in a way that it didn't need to be I wish that I had just walked away from it I don't know if I could have avoided the complete situation but I definitely could have May the outcome much less chaotic I guess that would be walking away from somebody who was definitely bad toxic from my life, but I really did want in my life and it was a true wrestling with morality and kind of sort of growing out my coming to a point where I have to say I'm going to do something that's really really hard for sort of Me no short-term pain for long-term gain and I had to make sort of an adult decision relationship-wise but it was still carry over into other areas of my life and taught me that you know you're not always going to feel great every decision is not going to be easy and feel good are you happy yes I was kind of forced to this issue was just what was going on in life was sort of can ignore those signs just yeah I guess it would be a particular argument I had with somebody that happened to be in sorry about public place and got in trouble for it I wish I could erase mileage to my family have a wonderful family completely blessed amazing parents have a brother and as he has a little girls have a baby niece that I love more than anything in the world and I could not ask for a better family therapy the idea my parents for sure there's wonderful people and then stop by example and I feel like I'm a good mix of both of them how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep pretty easy I try lately it's been a little bit hard my sleeps been off but for the most part I've come to recognize the importance of it and it's it's been pretty easy Lig fidgety maybe a little bit out of it I might might seem like I'm in a good mood cuz I might be a little Gideon laughing more just sort of high emotions but overall get irritated faster and just sweat more just feel feel just a little off not really just try to be more focused get things done I'm just trying to focus on what I want to do career-wise and really stop wasting time or if you know just procrastinating and get things done and being inspired going and seeing you and being around people that are doing what I want to do and just carrying it over to my own life no no oh just a couple days I was just in with my family and my baby niece in Florida and that's why I went down there to see her so it was just awesome I'm always happy when I see her probably as very funny humor would definitely probably one of the first things they would say joking always a little wiseass and my personality but they would describe me as always at unconditional there for them and just they know they know that I'm there if they need them always my drive be more driven and getting things done I guess it would be bought a recent a recent ex boyfriend that was a mistake of a relationship yeah sort of just the they think because he the way he felt about himself certain things he would say and even though what he said didn't directly make me feel about the whole situation made me realize the fact that I'm even with this person made me feel like I'm allowing people into my life that shouldn't be there so I'm dumbing myself down and that was terrible yes I regret not listening to my gut instincts don't second-guess yourself great listener constant sense of humor very malleable in terms of people tolerant and comfortable around all people from just all ages race gender

year I got to hang out in San Marcos for a little bit after I split up with my ex and then after San Marcos I went back to Iowa for a bunch of family stuff and then I brought my little brother to Los Angeles last week managed to go on a bike ride for ciclavia as I use basically a Rolling Green Light the entire way down Venice Boulevard and so he made me made a bunch of like national news and was all over the place but the rest of us as his support group riding around on topics and stuff they we didn't bat an eye we didn't blank because it has normal for a friend that wasn't even the most absurd thing he's done lately I was just at a happy normal Sunday but our group of friends is so unusual that a normal Sunday for us is Extreme for everyone else I used to be an introvert but definitely an extrovert the last few years thank you Los Angeles once I found the right group of friends it was easy to be social it drew me to be social extroverted even outgoing bombastic for the first time and it stuck if I weren't already the most relaxed guy already I would probably do things but when I'm really stressed out I do all sorts of stuff usually I tried to enlist my friends call me doing art project what temper panics cuz I really wanted to make him not hate me and I mostly failed hard on him I mostly unless I got by with a couple of scrapes on my Hugo when when that all went down I tried to talk to him but I got distracted for the very first time that day and so instead of having my rubber gloves up I managed to take a whole bunch of words to the side of the head and fall over trash cans it was not my most graceful moment something you feel guilty about I feel guilty about lots of stuff I feel guilty about eating more often than everything else because I really love junk food it's really good and I have very little food will power these to be that guy tell me about the hardest I'm not sure what the hardest decision I ever had to make was made a lot of hard decisions I guess it's very hard to leave Los Angeles after my ex and my best friend did a whole bunch of nasty stuff but I wasn't even that hard cuz it pushed me to do it so tricky questions oh you know Brooke collarbone severe pain get surgery on the LC like the time tell me about know my numbers are important I have lived a spoiled blessed life and if I changed anything then it wouldn't be the same universe I like this universe little brother lives here he's awesome he's actually right outside waiting for me my mom is crazy and my dad is crazy everyone else is crazy I'm pretty crazy but since most of the rest of them live so far away and don't have to deal with them too much relationship is positive and sparse jackrabbits been pretty positive influence Mi lately she is a magical creature well there's a part where she's intensely physically beautiful is the part where she manages to hit me with the best inspiration words there's the part where she actually works on the exact things that make me excited there's the part where she pops in and out of my life at the exact right instance and then there's the part where she is 100% kind and caring all the time all of those things are really nice but then when you add to that and compound it with the fact that she does this all without wanting anything in return smitten what a funny question how do I know them as though she's multiple people how did you know I know her through my bicycle friends the hard part is going to bed but as soon as I get to to sleep land time pretty much there until an earthquake hits so I can get to sleep poorly but then I'm a pro at it so it doesn't matter less verbose and that's about it my dark circles get slightly larger and I'm pretty much the exact same dude because I've been doing it most of my life so stoked that I might as well be on fire because the universe and its infant I suppose the word is sardonic sense of humor has managed to convince me of the reality of magic in the Archer City Park Simon's ISO as a fortunate and vaguely aware being it's my privilege to get to enjoy more time like this yeah my excitement is increasing at an almost exponential rate and feeling more and more inspired all the time if I could just work on the motivation I'm beside have you ever been not since you asked me on the phone a little while ago now I know I used to think I had it but who knows at this point those while ago I was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time and then I moved to Los Angeles and started having fun and then the rest is ancient history 2013 working on my shoes this morning was really nice doodling on our project that all my friends helped him put on that's that was pretty nice that's a nice feeling awesome a very good question I'm not actually sure I'll have some later today though I guess I'm Susie Astic I am historic and I am I'm going to have to say highly analytical be nice if I could get my superpowers back would be pretty cool like turning on some of the fancier finely-tuned and delicate Machinery that Chinese medicine has clued me in to inside myself to play tough one I think the thing that I'm most proud of would probably be I'm not actually sure 00 all sorts of stuff I'm working on that don't masturbate so much what are some things that you Jackrabbit really bad puns and dessert no problem hi Ellie okay what

72,458,"so you guys are controlling the virtual human okayyes I'm doing fine thank you I'm from Los Angeles California yes I love man saying I like the weather I like the lifestyle I like the variety of beach know we have it all things I don't like about La the rent is way way way way too expensive it's ridiculous I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have I'm well-travelled nice enjoy. I enjoy seeing new places going new places it's different every where the people are different it's fun okay well the most recent is last year I went to family reunions in New Orleans so that was in June and while I was there we also visited Slidell Louisiana for the the swamp tours and Vicksburg Mississippi where my mom is from and we spent the night in Ferriday Louisiana with my aunt to will be 101 this year in May there's a lot as far as traveling or just. Most memorable experience and well I don't know if it's just one probably when I used to travel with my dad that's where I got a lot of my traveling from can you tell me about yeah it was best car sometimes planes mostly white just I guess I'll say mostly down south but it was really fun especially the road trips just a general and also drama what's your dream job my dream job is to become a real estate investor well I've sort of really been into it every since 2005 I just don't have the capital right now or the connections but since I do like real estate I'm just going to start off as a real estate agent so I should have my license sometime this year outgoing I'm well I'm not sure why it could be a little bit of both but I'm pretty outgoing well speaking of Hawaii I did live there for a year and a half but what do I do to relax is either I'm usually take a nap take a bath or just try to get things off of my mind and try to spend my energy in more positive ways it needs to be worked on but I know when to control it when I need to well me and my ex-husband still get into arguments is this just over a text message but I'm actually it was my fault but usually it's his but it just starts little and kind of snowballs out of control butt that's usually how it goes well I don't know what else to do except for pray on it because I thought once I moved into another house it would be over but I see that we're still getting into it so I don't know maybe ignore it or if he wants to be right than them be right I guess probably quite a few things but I don't regret anything I've done in my life but situation I wish I would have handled differently just kind of everything in my life almost I could have done it differently or I would if I had the chance but I'm not worried about it cuz I don't regret anything that I've done in my life tell me about the hardest decision probably when I had to get a divorce that that may have been the hardest a one of the hardest decisions it was just a lot of a lot of stuff through the years the relationship is kind of deteriorated the relationship between us was still good then the things that he were doing I would have been able to overlook it a little bit more because I would feel like well our relationship is good and it's difficult to find a really really good relationship but since our relationship deteriorated and there's just a lot of disagreement and arguing and problems financial problems and he's doing this so I I just decided just forget it I mean I tried but you know he didn't want to cooperate so well I'm happy with what's going on now I mean I wish that we could still be a family but since that's not going to happen yes I am happy with my life right now yes something I can erase I don't think I really need to erase anyting I finally got an over the way the kids treated me at school but other than that I can't think of anything to erase it's fair / good there is no problems right now so I guess I'll just say good yeah there's no problem well I would have to say my mother yes I'm with she's just always supported me and everything that I've done whether it's good or not so good so I think that's a blessing sometime sometime it's not well I just don't get enough hours of sleep I guess that's what it is cuz I would like to sometimes so that's more the problem I would like to get I'm just sleepy yeah sleepy tired feeling like I want to go take a nap I've been feeling fine I know they've been about the same have you ever been no no I'm really happy probably last week because I got over to a little bit of money so well I guess my best friend will be my mom or maybe my entertainment friend that I've been knowing since 96 I really wouldn't I'm not going to say I don't consider him a best friend that we don't really hang out that much but he is very ungenerous to me and my mom so well right now I spend my weekends doing chores and classwork and sleeping in but maybe after the class work is out of the way maybe I could do something else myself well I do wish that at times I could control my temper a little more and of course I would like to lose weight be a little bit more active and I wish my skin would clear up it was probably when I was in school school years or terrible for a lot of people because the kids are animals so they try to make you feel like you're nothing like your piece of turd on to their foot so that's probably the last time is an adult now I would say that I'm genuine I'm honest I'm supportive and I'm just a good friend no did you give yourself well 20 years ago just because you're pregnant that doesn't mean that you're eating for two and you can eat loads of food like people tell you that's the main thing I'm I'm going to tell my daughter's no I'm just eat as you normally eat the eat more healthier there's no need to gain 80 lb when the baby is just 20 pounds or less and you have all this weight to lose also know if I came into any money now 20 years ago I was probably just thinking about shopping or just kind of spending it on frivolous stuff where is now I would invest it so yeah I think that's about it proud of I guess maybe myself my kids hey thank you bye with very gradually rising, very trembling, very low, very small pitched voice",0

75,462,"alright wonderful okay thanks yeah I'm okay I'm from Los Angeles oh the weather the weather the weather the weather the beach the weather the beach the laid-back miss the driving instead of public transportation and a sporty I really I don't know the lack of I don't know there's not a lot I don't like about Olay it's compared to most cities I really it's my favorite and I've lived around the world I love it I love La a lot I'm sure you can tell by me yes I've lived in Paris and I've been around the world a lot it's just dumb it's fun and it's it's it's it's it's a blast it's good to see new places it's good to get to get to experience all the fantastic I'm sites and in in cultures well I mean I I I tended to actually do a lot of them I probably would do them differently I think I'm more developed as a person now I lived in Paris for two years so and I lived in Spain for Spain was fun Spain Madrid is a party town and then and then to these were all work they were all work so that was working so it was on his grind and you didn't really appreciate you know what was around you so much and then I mean I still I still love going just to you know vacation spots like a Y A N Dent Tamika I'm still just really a sucker for that kind of stuff I guess Madagascar was pretty much like just really bitching because it was it was in the eighties and it was like you were seeing a lot of people that have never seen white people before according to the guy driving us around I might he might have been lying but it was just it was bitching and Africa was pretty much the best Senegal and Madagascar I'm right now about to go for an early childhood education degree and then I did a little bit of a paralegal but that was really just to just to get the just to get the Skype and I didn't really have any concept of what I want to do now I really do I have I was saying to Rachel actually I don't know if you guys are able to overhear I really think that the way the school system goes right now is it just it it turns people into into I'm just a just a doggy dog. You know I don't like the way I think it's told draining the school system right now and I feel pretty bad for everybody so I want to try to fix that that would be my dream job that's so I'm excited like I want to go in a direction that I want to go and yeah that would be my dream job is to work with sort of getting kids on it more organic Universal you know trajectory I think it could be done I don't think it would be done via any sort of legislation except here and there I mean that always ends up becoming you know facade in Farsi itself anyway but I think there are ways I've always reached kids anyway and I've always felt where I was coming from and so I think you know there are ways to sort of buck the system without even talking to the system I guess I'm just a combination of the two I don't think I don't know actually I'm kind of might even be working that out there might be some outgoingness to overcompensate for what's actually shyness and vice versa. Yeah that's cool I definitely try to reflect and stay in a pretty Lucid space is often as possible so a lot of lying down at the moment I'm in transition so there's just a lot of and I hang out with my dog's a lot so that's quite soothing why I try not to do I don't really do anything that's to can't unless it's time for like time to drive to a job or time to you know go make some things happen meetings and stuff but otherwise I try to stay in a pretty relaxed space most of the time so it's not like breaking but you know and I meant I'm assuming I can't believe summer is coming so I'm going to swim some more to when I'm truly outraged it comes out and then I I'm I'm I'm hitting some kind of bad part right next time I'm fighting for my child so there are times when I will just cuss up a storm just to get off some steam a little bit but usually pretty much there's always you know someone in the periphery that gets it and and you know it's like that bumper sticker If you're not outraged you're not paying attention so usually some kind of Sanity can prevail oh well I mean these are also times where I just can't find something in the car and a bit when I argue with people it's been a lot of the times when I'm being flat out you know sabotage drawer definitely when you know I lost my temper dreadfully with unfortunately the woman that gave me birth because that she is intrinsic and a lot of I mean she's pretty much horrible person so I recently lost my temper with her I felt like I mean I I like again I think I should have said this just now I felt in a way good because I get it you know which is as opposed to not getting it which is even worse but I guess there's another side of the bank of the thing to get to to where you can be a little more constructive about it it's like you know you get to a point where you're glad you can actually see that there's a horrible travesty going on but then you have to figure out how to deal with a horrible try to stay but so I mean I didn't feel like shame I really honestly didn't feel shame I didn't I didn't feel there times when I feel like it was stupid to lose my temper just because there are people that will try to use that against you that's all but I never really feel bad for being angry about what I'm angry about well when I was pregnant I wish I had like I said I went through such an Awakening about realizing when I was being sort of undermined that that demanding my respect became a huge issue and when I was pregnant I ended up being so disrespected in the place cuz I was being a hippie on the beach for 6 years so I was it felt like I was being so disrespected in the place where I was set to be when the child arrived at I stormed out via what was a good survival mode before but left me jumping out of the frying pan Into the Fire and they got my kid so yeah it's fucked up I don't want to erase anything from my memory I like having everything Consolidated and cohesive I don't and integrated I don't want to erase anything from my memory well did I get it right or did I get it wrong I guess the hardest decision was whether or not to sign sign mediation agreement with DCFS in and I should have said no let's just go straight to court because that there is nothing wrong with me I just happened to succumb to an SSI check via bulshit with my mother's and I should have just been you know brave enough to just go in there and do that and instead I chickened out and did their mediation and they played me out over consciousness it's horrific horrendous Borgia quality Intrigue and sabotaged it's bad that's okay someone that I mean there's been you know there's been some some great people that again from a far I have not sort of really achieved a real great ability to build relationships and I'm working through that great writing it right now and I think that's a lot why don't I have my son but as I've grown in developed I have seen encouragement from like-minded souls and you can see that and say that's wonderful and but otherwise you know a constant you know contact with someone that's really good for me it has been hard for me to get to that point how is your day not so easy if he says it all I'm being I've been I'm not completely centered and then there's been some actual you know people thinking it's funny to harass me or jolt me as they walked by and so there's been actual harassment and stuff like that I'm still pretty Pollyanna doubt I still look forward to head and try to be as pleasant as possible I'm tired and drained and a little bit frustrated because that I know that I've been sort of that I sort of have a bit of my energy and and space being usurped and I can tell and I don't know how to get through that and passed it no no there are I'm basically a very very very happy pretty much list out person but this fighting for my son has me sort of trudging areas that it is it the same trees that were thrown in my Road in childhood before I realize I was such a happy person or thrown there again so I'm going through some of the same pitfalls and mistakes but you know during the day I'll I'll think something completely true and organic and I'll just stare at something to wow that's beautiful and I'll be reminded pretty close to my spirit so I try to stay there 24/7 I'm pretty spiritual that way I mean if I had one that was willing to say all the nice things about me gets pretty competitive out there that you know that I'm this is off you guys that I'm funny and that and that I think that's bad I'm done funny and that I'm good and that that I'm trustworthy Legacy West just not necessarily change but grow through my ability to connect with the people I want to connect with and disconnect from the people that manage to to drain me I already said I regret the thing with them leaving the place where I could have delivered my son even though I was being abused get the fuck away from your mother you know and like a lot of and and yeah and two open your eyes look what look what's going on I'm proud of my spirit and my Outlook and my my access to what's really going on in the world and my awakeness I'm just proud of me

76,463,"okay cool hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today yes I am I am pretty good I was born in Los Angeles California yes I like the fact that everything is closed by all the stores and shops the traffic I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot of trouble but not too much going away from your usual days exploring new sites 3 weeks notice a month ago I went to Las Vegas with me and my friends and we just went sightseeing in Las Vegas we went to the Hoover Dam and it was breathtaking the it was really big and we saw the Big Canyon and it was impressive I never seen something like that before I studied nursing I graduated two months ago so I took my board exam to be licensed and I passed so I'm just waiting for my license in the mail my dream job is to be a registered nurse long time ago when I was a little boy I got injured and my parents had to take me to the hospital and the doctors came by and they had to stitch me up on the leg and I saw all of that and that made me want to pursue the medical field are you happy yes I am very happy my relationship with my family is okay not good not bad it's if it's in between I am close I am very close to them if I have a problem or I go to them for help someone who's been a positive influence has been my best friend since elementary school yes yes we've known each other since we were in the third grade and we've we've gone to a lemon tree middle school and high school together and he lives like two blocks away so he's basically like like a brother of mine I am shy I really don't know I've always been a quiet person ever since I can remember what do I do if I I going to my room I turn my AC on and I just relax in my bed I am pretty good I'm pretty good at controlling my temper yes the last time I argued with someone was about work I was disappointed not angry just disappointed because my manager he wanted me to do something faster than what I usually can handle and he already knew that my workload was a lot but he didn't understand that so that made me just very like sad I cannot remember one the hardest decision I ever had to make was dropping out of school I felt that I didn't really belong far away from home and so I was just thinking ahead I was in a major that I didn't really like and so I decided to just not go next semester and go back home to LA are you happy right now that I'm looking at it yes I am very happy that I did that because I wouldn't have gone to nursing school and I wouldn't have been a licensed vocational nurse right now I don't have an event how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep it depends on the days where I work or where I don't work yes right now I I work at at a retail store early in the morning I I go at 3 in the morning and I get out at 10 a.m. so it's really hard for me to get a good night sleep when I don't sleep well I can be a little bit grumpy irritated or just frustrated with the situation lately I've been okay I'm been good no I have not okay no no the last time I was really really happy and excited was when I found out that I passed my license board exam to be a nurse my best friend would have just would describe me as a caring nice sweet shy quiet guy physically speaking I would change how I look from the outside I am overweight and I would like to lose some weight and just look good from the outside I don't have one no I don't just one time I at my work it's a retail store I kind of took some merchandise without buying it what made you decide to do that it was a risk that I took but since no one was around and D up the opportunity was right there for me to get it I just got it and I took it home I don't know yes last weekend I went to I went yard selling with my family and it was pretty fun going out to different yard sales and finding random stuff I bought this big black bean bag it was huge and it was on it was only for $2 and so I got it and now it's in my room and I sit on it I am most proud of is the fact that I am a nurse that I am a nurse I'm just waiting for my for my license in the mail and after that I would just send out my resumes to different hospitals and call Aunt nursing homes I think I got everything I need thanks for sharing your thoughts bye with very gradually rising, trembling, low, small pitched voice",0
77,464,"alright coolI'm doing good what about youLos Angeles but I couldn't even recited Inglewood we did I answer your question I don't know okay La the murals the ocean what else the people my family is over here so that's the best part what about you I would say the smog yeah the air had to be cleaner and yeah that's what I mean is good people bad people too but yeah for the most part it's all good yeah I've been in Mexico and the temples and it was in California so yes traveling like Tina are that's good healthy for the body cleaner blood flow the people culture and stories and then come back you share stories with like your friends yeah anytime like right now or when okay so I just one time I was a kid we went out to the temples and it started raining so we just start walking through in like when we get to the top one thing I didn't know before is that the higher you go does the smartest steps get so like people back then had on a smaller feet so what happened was as I went higher towards the temple I had to walk sideways so my feet can measure up to that the steps but once you get up there tonight to you I am general education but mainly art yeah I took a lot of art classes well when I was a kid I scribble and walls with Crayola so I figured you know like it kind of stuck around with me so I just posted it so yeah my dream job would be to get paid for painting painting art yeah yeah pretty simple it's not so much that it's hard it just requires passion persistence and faith and well you just have to really believe in yourself to yourself the more likely you are able to succeed I consider myself to be shy and certain time of places but I am also outgoing when like I have the energy so I feel like it's well-balanced you know like I'm shy when it's I guess okay to be shy you know and I'm outgoing when like the need to actually have fun or just explore feels good like if I make sense but yeah screensaver yeah 2 hour relax either well I'm going to say this but I smoke weed so that helps and I like painting painting humans help me relax you know blue on relax me and also green when I use these two colors and make a painting account calms me down I didn't have a blue shirt yeah my temper well my thoughts and my thoughts control my emotions and my emotions yeah scream until my temporary getting mad or if I do get mad what will be the outcome you know so control my temper is just like training my thought the last time I argued with somebody was with my with my father and it was because I wanted to eat food but he wanted me to buy wine so right when the food was ready I was hungry eating you like nope so that kind of frustrated me and the way I handled it was like well I could just eat when I come back and I'm doing him a favor so you know and then after you not to eat and eat in peace so yeah my family is pretty good my mom and dad have a good relationship and still married and my brothers and sisters we help one another out so that's good it's just yeah it's a good team a situation I wish I could handle differently would be that's a good question I mean can I get scenario okay situation and kind of differently what you got something I feel like if I'm calm in any situation I could figure it out you know but if it came down to like a Rubik's Cube maybe how to handle the situation would be just buy a feeling I'm feeling making mistakes because I don't make the right mistakes and the right lessons will come after so that's the best way I could answer your question you know yeah deposit influence pretty much anybody who told me the truth has been a positive influence influence you know like yeah even though it may hurt like all the truth does hurt well they're not trying to be mean that actually good influences I was in my friends my mom and dad my brother my sister's yeah we'll see that's the thing like I have I've had some pretty bad experiences with like being at gunpoint and with a knife but at the end of the day with that did was like give me more insight made me more aware and it taught me how to read people a little bit more like dispense things out and also how to avoid situations so even though it was bad and it did kind like scar me a different pair me for like the world you know because it's happened to me when I was like 12 13 years old so if everyday could be exposed to like you know like guns nice and all that stuff so it's it's bad but it's good in a long-term you know because if you get out of that slump it's like nothing else would really phase you because you think you might have been through worse so it's not as bad as you know and so yeah the hardest this one right now I don't feel like answering when I got stuck I like kind of think I was part of it but Hearts decision as far as like life-changing life changing whether to continue school college or not I kind of chose to like I went to school but I chose to pursue my own like like I'm there any more advice can I give myself with people who are already in the field I want to be in so that was a hard choice because there was no guarantee that I would like run into like the right people but I took that chance you know I'm at the right people so yeah yeah yeah how easy is it for you to get a good night actually really easy I sometimes like I could sleep right now in like 10 minutes you know I just like like soda my air pattern lately I've been feeling good I've been feeling like I have free will like at this point in time I feel like if I chose a path any path with like my heart I could get there you know but I'm kind of like still deciding if I carry sing in August pass or in the air or should I make my own I don't know that's why I'm at I feel like a free will oh yeah ladylike in the past 2 weeks or today okay yeah you know like yeah things happen that would change like my feelings and example right now they just happened right now like this experience for one is kind of like a shift in my thought because yeah it's like it's technology you know it's like it's a trip to see how far I like one could take a thought and then make it reality so that's kind of like shifting my thoughts right now this experience this whole experience yeah post-traumatic stress disorder no depression I know how it's like to be depressed but diagnosed by a doctor no depression how how it feels how does depression feel like it feels like it's like a bird in the cage being depression is like being a fish who can't swim in the water have feeling depression is like being A Bird Without Wings pretty much it feels like you're limited but then a thing is to get out of that depression if I get to awaken and change your perspective and focus on like I would say colors colors help and people talking to people helps yeah being depressed 16 I don't know like it could come like it to happen everyday like it's small doses doses so like I could say today you know earlier when I was just by myself I felt a little depressed then what happened I fixed it like a cut up a friend and met up with him and yeah I mean at this moment I feel pretty happy you know I'm talking to average person is pretty cool and yeah right now if you're happy sometimes hard headed like you would try to teach me a certain investment whether it's art or just like in my character and yeah he just described me as like like like Listen by the same thing he'll still do what he wants to do but it's so pretty much like I don't know yeah I mean that's what he tells me but your overall good person I just exercised my diet food my food intake and yeah health I would say when I was like in middle school or in elementary little bit too but yeah it would be was it would either be about will Pumas my heart like something and I thought it was good and then someone else be like all you know that looks kind of like like trash and then I'll be like oh damn I could accept and be like yeah it does kind of look and then fix it or why would do back then we'll be like damn you know you're going to do well and I thought and then just like stay there for a bit and then eventually I'll come out of it but yeah you should use bone people's words and ideas that yeah yeah I said it regret yeah I got a couple things I regret like what well sometimes I feel like I should have completed the whole university thing but I mean at the same time I feel like if I really wanted to go I would have gone so yeah that's kind of regret my head 10 or 20 years ago would be on seek spiritual well-being you know learn how to handle your thoughts to your thoughts I will teach myself pick the people you surround yourself with because that definitely has a major influence in your environment Street events you experience and as far as your overall happiness yeah among other things but yeah I'm most proud of right now is my paintings I'm proud of that because like I feel like depends on releasing are things that no one else could duplicate you know it's like it's one of a kind of Nikes is there you know is Sazon signature something so yeah I'm pretty happy about that yeah thank you are you thinking alright bye yeah with very gradually rising, very steady, very high, very small pitched voice",0

have been handled differently it could have been handled differently if they would have been handling things differently than I wouldn't have to react it's not like I was mad I was acting awful

okay okay yeah I was like can you waive the hedges with no can I wave at you. with very gradually rising, steady, high, very small pitched voice",0
79,466,"I was that man when do I talk okay okay okay yeah that okay okay it's better okay thanks okay thank you thank you yes okay Los Angeles the weather the variety of environments the ocean you know various different environment or environmental variety I don't like the superficiality of people the narcissistic attitude just the it doesn't have a small-town sort of feel where you know just the warm the human sort of warms the interactively so yeah no am I have a fear of flying and I have developed agoraphobia incredibly difficult I'm guessing you mean the agoraphobia more so than the fear of flying it's it's more of a recent development and it's it's pregret it's progressing to be worse it's very what's the word immobilizing and very distressing actually yes it is how do I cope with that just just trying to do the best I can and try to you know have the most courage I can in the situation and challenge myself and small steps I read a lot I do I'm bibliotherapy reading and I try to inform myself of the of the professional literature I'm so that I could hopefully over comment someday yes definitely certain things trigger at like enclosed spaces being in a car traveling being away from home being in someone else's car things that are outside of my locus of control add actually I don't go to school right now my dream job is to be a psychologist I'm not a psychologist but what would make me decide to do that is having lived through some challenges like this having lived through some traumas but I've always had an interest in it since junior high of I'm very interested in people and Men human interaction and human connection and the betterment of of of those things bridging people together and helping people interpersonally through their child personal challenges so that's that's sort of in a nutshell I think I'm someone who's I can be very outgoing and sort of a warm and friendly presents very easily but I think on the exterior but I think I'm shy and I challenged it to do that I think it hard I'm shy but I but I challenge myself completely cuz I do love human interaction so I take those risks and and jump and those challenges the last time I interacted with somebody was today if I think I'm understanding your question correctly oh no I think I misunderstand your question but I I interacted with Rachel I just I'm continuously interacting with people take taking those risks a very good very good I just left them argued with somebody actually can't remember it wasn't recent I have to think about that I don't know yet let me think I'm drawing a blank I can only remember things from what I was like 21 right now I can't think of anything contemporary right right now my mind is okay I when I was younger can you tell me about that yes I lost a relationship with my aunt and my uncle and my cousin's cuz when I was 21 on 45 I I had a disagreement with my aunt and I said something that was a critical of her and she threw me out of their home and let me back I apologized immediately and they let me back into their lives and change their minds so I regret that I'm assuming you mean how do I feel when they asked me to never I'll be in their lives again and to leave shattered Soul shattered heart shattered tell me about well that that was my family that was the good side of my family there's the majority of my fat they were they were the the loving aspect of my family on the rest of my family is very cruel and very abusive I'm I don't have any relationship with my family at all like there since I was 21 since my aunt and uncle disown me I guess it's the right word estranged yeah gosh I'm drawing a blank just bear with me for one second something I could erase I can't even get it to my memory as an example I was injured and I wish I could get that away from my memory yeah I was injured in the emergency room doing I went in for food poisoning I was ordered to go in by a doctor I had collapsed and I was ordered to go into the ER for that I said food poisoning and I came out injured with a neurological syndrome I was injured with a what do you call it intravenous procedure and now I have RSD reflex sympathetic dystrophy and the scene in the emergency room was it was an out-of-control saying there was a problem with the procedure and the doctor was yelling at his staff who made a mistake and it was extremely excruciating it was a crisis and so every time I think about the injury and it was disfigured I got disabled got disabled for disabled permanently from it was also a disabled from my employment for a quite amount of a given amount of time as well and and it I have residual physical Trauma from it and disfigurement and severe disability disability limited functionality with my right my I'm right-handed my right hand and arm thank you tell me about the hardest decisions I don't even know what that is you know I I really I apologize cuz I can't really probably give you the most suitable answer I'm guessing it has something to do with my cat and her her urgent what do you call it I heard she was in intensive care veterinary care and I'm sure it had something to do with that but other than that I would say I had Choosing My Life Path weather and I was admitted to that program or whether I was going to go to art school for four years and I had to pick a life Direction but that's not a traumatic situation so I don't know how best to answer your question I can't I have severe nightmares and I have nocturnal panic attacks are you triggered by something and I also have physical illness on top of it and I'm in excruciating pain you have disturbing thoughts yes yes yes they're triggered by the injury that I told you they're triggered by my family how they've treated me what they said to me what they've done to me they're triggered by what else my my physical illness not my injury Olney but my physical illness as well so yes I feel very ill and feel so fatigued very ill and very fatigued when I don't sleep and get enough sleep at my anxiety level I believe is up and I'm susceptible to feeling distressed so yeah yes 3 years ago my most recent diagnosis and in 2001 as well oh yes 3 years ago and when I was 20 years old the my background my childhood from my family of origin and there are the abuse that I went through and their ultimate what's the word rejection of me and estrangement that was the first reason no I stopped 6 months ago why did I stop I'm just taking a break I'm going to continue yes very much it's helped tremendously I think it helps with anxiety at helps with it helps Inspire crate inspiration that helps feeling connected it helps to create what I ultimately my goal is to give myself a voice and it helps to to side is part of that process it also helps to understand myself to learn about myself and there's just so many benefits it's I'll stop right there and there's many more the last time I felt really happy is it was a really long time ago it was before my illness and it was in 1997 on the outside of my illness was in July of 97 so it was before that yes I was in a very good place in terms of my career in terms of my just my relationships and everything was just sort of at its best career relationships personal fulfillment start of as well I was very active and and doing a very many things that were made in full to build a life thumb and I was in the process of just in the in the planning stages of my life but also very accomplished at the same time so it's just that they were just going very well and I was just really liked just where my life was at it was just in a really good place and many ways I wish I could change about myself my anxiety I wish I could change about myself my agoraphobia my PTSD meeting my trauma and what else my insecurities as far as just with other people in the sense that I'm always trying to make sure that that I don't do something that that hold on one second I'm just trying to make sure that I don't do anything that's offensive to them or insults them or is disrespectful and I I feel like I'm overly cautious about that and it kind of becomes an anxiety unto itself so I I definitely think that would be beneficial to change the other thing I'd like to change about myself and I wish I could feel and also depression I'd like to change about myself I wish I could feel better I wish I didn't feel so tired of the burden that I do love my family I'm not having one and what else I wish I didn't have my illness and the physical excruciating pain that I'm in so those are some things and I also wish that and this is a byproduct of PTSD I wish that I didn't have the the symptom ology of PTI say is that definitely affects one's complete complete life like her life completely and I wish I was more articulate and I wish I was someone who was well-spoken and someone was well-written but there's many there's many more things that I wish I could change about myself to improve myself so many more I'm not sure maybe to not be so trusting I trusted I trusted some medical professionals that you know again created the injury and it a word there's a what's the word there's an expectation and it sort of a demand to just blindly trust the medical profession and don't ask questions or just sort of you know and if not to trust your own self your own your own instincts or intuition and so I would I would have told myself to be a little more careful I guess if that's useful to your question what did I really enjoy and I can't think of anything specific but I know it would have to do with either reading or connecting with someone on a meaningful level I'm most proud of my compassion my my empathy and caring about people despite I mean I'm proud of it anyways but I'm also particularly am I come from an environment that's the opposite on the background and then the wasn't taught that but I really do care about people and I'm I guess I'm most proud of that I'm also proud of my career accomplishments and my tenacity my my Fierce tenacity to succeed and you know just also to get the strength it takes to get through the injury to live with it and to live with the illness that I live at the physical illness so I think that would be it yes okay you're welcome bye okay I've been crying and opening up to this person so I think I did but what you're what you wanted right I'm embarrassed cuz I got really sort of involved like she was asking questions that you know we're really at the heart of you know some of your pay and you know and I was honest about it so the video is like oh my God she don't like this person like that I'm sure this is what you were hoping that someone genuinely interact right with someone okay cool okay okay oh thank you yeah I didn't know I'd with very gradually rising, trembling, low, loud pitched voice",0
80,467,"yeah I'm okay with it I feel pretty good little nervous because I've never done anything like this before that's why from Ohio Cincinnati two months ago two and a half months I was just looking for wanted to be in a new environment oh yeah I'm ecstatic very happy I took a few weeks just to get adjusted cuz I don't know it the weather is probably the best thing yeah I know been other than that pretty much the same as everywhere else I've been it's nothing I don't really like about la since you know the weather is the best part of it I like to travel somewhat I haven't travelled a lot of my life but over the past year-and-a-half I've done done quite a bit of traveling seeing different places different people new people new faces new places but she lasts will last summer I spent the summer in Cleveland doing the urban farming in the city I stayed at a hospital the first hospital in Cleveland and I was at doing program with the and it was basically we would go to different Urban Farms throughout the city and volunteer about 20 25 hours a week oh yeah really a spur-of-the-moment type of thing wanted to try something different something I've never done before and farming is one of those things that you know most people would never try cuz of a you know cuz of a certain stigma that comes along with it and you know I just thought it would be fun and interesting to do something like that what in the urban farming or in general Urban farming how do I guess I don't know just just the overall experience is going you know eating and going to the farmers markets and eating all the fresh food and just send the difference in you know how fresh natural food tasted you know as opposed to the foodie by the grocery store yeah it is really this I was I took two semesters of a college and I was undecided so I was just taking General classes my dream job it's my dream job with the D anything that involves I don't know how like a specific dream job or anything that involves nature just being outside I would like to I wouldn't mind being like a like a forest ranger or something like that as long as I have you know yeah consider myself more shy don't like don't know why it's just the way it is I read listen to music a draw watch movies stuff like that I think I'm pretty good at it I think yeah wow yeah I can't remember the last time I hear argument with someone I don't know again I don't know because I don't dwell on things that happened in the past maybe whether or not to come to California I guess that was a hard decision well I don't know I've been thinking about it you know moving to a new place for a long time and I guess hardest part of the decision was thinking weather whether or not I will be secure or not you know what I mean just going to a new place we don't know anyone kind of are you really don't know what's going to happen so there was a lot of you know fear not in that decision should I go to a place where I don't know anyone I don't I'm not familiar with the area you know only only perception of a hat that I have of this area's you know what I've seen on it and media media and TV so you know yeah I guess that was the hardest hardest decision that I can think of I guess so nothing absolutely nothing yeah nothing I don't feel guilty about anything relationship with my family I'm not really close to my family I guess the person I'm closest to as my mom but you know I don't you know I never really talked to her much I don't really know my dad that well so you know guess my grandmother yeah she yes she's she's very how should I say it she's very to The Thinker I put it like that like she's very insightful so you look so her for a lot of advice because she's been through a lot through a lot in her life I feel like she you know she's been through a lot so she understands a lot so let you know she's a very positive influence very easy maybe unsure I would say because right now I really don't know what direction I want to go in with my life and it's been a lot of confusion with that but you know it's not it's not something that overly affects me but you know it's always a thought in the back of my mind felt feels like somehow maybe I'm running out of time I know that's not like that's not it that's not a realistic thought because I don't see how you could ever run out of time but yeah I guess yeah just general not knowing what I want but I know like how do I cope with that how do I cope with that I don't know I just do a lot of thinking a lot of soul-searching it's not hard I mean I mean it's like I can't say it's hard because it's one of those things that I feel like it's necessary and you know certain things in life you just you're forced to face so it's harder to I think it's harder to avoid those type of things no no no today when I talk when I talk to my friend earlier awesome how would my best friend describe me I guess you would say I'm quiet if you describe me as a nice guy insightful Goofy no I don't really think like that no 10 or 20 years ago I guess I will tell myself to stick with whip what stick with what I love did a acting Workshop and numb I don't know if I've always been interested mine and I decided why not no try it so you like it what am I most proud of like an event or an accomplishment cuz I pride myself on being independent bye with very

snowboarding the day if you're hiking up in these mountains Santa Monica Mountains to be exact I don't like the traffic I don't like the congestion a few people here and I don't like the price of the cost of living in specific areas I'm sure you can tell by my I've been trying to actually last year was the summer of really Road trippin and getting out there if my girlfriend we're looking at a Costa Rica and hopefully South America this summer and then maybe even doing a road trip down the South Seas in the southern states but I've been in a Canada been to Mexico and Ecuador iron been to various States here and they're trying to get out there I love meeting new people I love experiencing new things trying different different foods that are native to that local area and she's part of the journey I just I love exploring this you know this planet we call Earth just recently went to Seattle and Canada with a couple friends and who's gorgeous we have flew into Seattle and we saw the city for the first two three days and then rented a car and headed over to Vancouver Canada and saw British Columbian why was he gorgeous just very large beautiful trees the the climate was nice the ocean was right there's people are great it's just a fun trip all around one of my most memorable experiences was probably the the trip we took the Colorado last summer and me and my girlfriend flew into Denver and we didn't really have a plan we knew we knew of a couple people were living there and just the day before we had contacted them and tell them we're coming the area and they're just showed great Hospitality they picked us up at the airport lettuce crash at their place for a couple days we even let us use their card it's for the state and go to Wyoming and see the neighbors to the north it was just a great trip great people and it was just everything worked out very well just everyday is there something new and fun to do yeah I study business management and economics right now I'm I've always wanted to own my own business and I figured Mansion PA Agera Foundation to build on and I'll learn more about so I decide to go to management just to see the various aspects of what it takes to really manage your own business and then economics was just too just for long-term Investments are really want to start running some stocks and ETFs and mutual funds and start building my profolio up so I figured now that would be great way for a long-term investment financially so that's why did my economics yeah I'm really stoked was one of the best decisions probably mine my life I consider myself more outgoing them I'm pretty friendly hiking don't mind to open up to people and stuff how to be outside like to go hiking want to go working out the gym but I most like to be outdoors I love nature and just be outside just just puts me at ease from pretty good for the most part I'm pretty mellow chill guy and when I do get angry here and there it just lasts for like a couple minutes and before I know it I just it just blows over I don't tend to hold on to things or stay angry and hold grudges just cuz there's no need to Life's too short for all that see I can't remember the last time I argue with anybody I have no idea probably when Maya my brother and my girlfriend got a little little argument I'd like to birthdays ago and it's been awkward kind ever since I wish you would just handle that right then and there rather than letting it just stretch out as long as it has been it's just awkward for both parties I was just go to communicate with both of them and told them that the differences aside and was just communicating try to come up with a solution but now it's just awkward yeah it does tell me about the hardest the hardest decision I've ever had to make and the Tuffy I don't think I've had too many tough decisions really say the hardest decision I've ever had to make on maybe not moving to Colorado for my undergrad to three years ago was a little touch of slick kind of think what if but other than that nothing has really been too tough on my life that was really that hard of a decision when you feel guilty don't really feel guilty about anything pretty good person I think and for the most part I can think of any then so now I could wish I could erase my memory nothing really be honest I love all my memories are usually positive for the most part I know it's kind of wait for somebody to say but I've looked pretty good life and I'm happy yeah it's cool I'm pretty independent the most part so when I do see him here in the ants if we go through long periods of times with no contact maybe a couple weeks sometimes even a month but I want to see if it's good you know I like to say hi and show him I love him still and it's not that I don't mean to like not contact him that you're always contact me but it's good for the most part I guess is a young adult my girlfriend's family they've been very positive in my life I wasn't for them I think of you in a different direction just in high school I didn't really care about higher education I didn't care about really thinking long-term and I just seeing them and what their family dies and how they think differently like through higher education and how to get somewhere in life and if you do these things is to work at will you too and they've been very successful they own their own no accounting practice and seen that influence me to achieve higher in life pretty easy for the most part I just close my eyes and wake up in the morning I'm tired sometimes it's enzyme a little drained and maybe a little groggy in there and that's it showing pretty good for the most part a little stressed out just cuz finals around next week and I really really want to do well and just seen a close out this last semester and I graduate in two weeks and for the most part that's that's one thing I'm really nervous about but for the most part I'm really excited and looking forward to going

graduated from nursing school on Monday and I just hear walk across stage and stuff just cuz we've been together for 6 years Tina go through the nursing program for 5 and it's just ups and downs it's really good to see somebody just drive through and Achieve what they wanted to cheat and just been really proud of her yeah probably outgoing friendly Positive Vibes all around adventurist love sports team player knows how to be a leader in there and it's a little outspoken sometimes not really for the most part no not really feeling more motivated to do something motivating right now I'm just because I'm just done with school and I'm over at that I just don't feel as motivated but I just want to be more motivated and determined right now and that's not I'm not going that way right now so no biggie how man I couldn't can really think of a Time Owen caving 2 weeks ago that was a lot of fun we went up to Sequoia National Park and I went caving with the trainer CNA classes like this site Recreation tourism management class and Kayden with an elective and our professor was at the world-renowned cave specialist and they took us to these various caves in the Sequoia and just me and these strangers are my classmates and becoming really good friends with him was a lot of fun and rappelling down in a cats climb back up going through different rooms and shoots it was a lot of fun Dallas

Kind of like have a quiet environment and maybe lay down and watch a little TV or something I'm very good at controlling my temper I don't like to get really angry or upset or get to where I'm going to hurt somebody when I really have arguments there like because people don't agree to disagree and if it's like really Petty it's like we might say it's just like my opinion and they don't agree with my opinion so we argue about that but it's like nothing really big or anything like that just stupid I don't even remember when you feel guilty about probably not working right now I need a job yes maybe I don't really remember a situation I've tried to really think before I really handle a situation and I try to handle it in a my best positive way before I really do something I regret being

going to the 6th grade and I'm kind of excited for that you find it easy to be a parent sometimes is easy but sometimes it gets a little overwhelming the hardest thing about being a parent is being a single parent it's just you always have to have somebody to bring you Joy I enjoy always doing things with my daughter is just about making a lot of sacrifices and just always is brings me so much joy being a parent well my parents when I was younger they lived apart so my mom I don't know I'm I'm a much better parent cuz I'm more interested about what my child wants to do I'm involved in her life her every step just I'm really fully in my parents wasn't really that involved you know they had a drug problem so it just at the mature a lot faster than a lot of other kids so it was just my parents and their drug addiction I wish I could erase that from my memory now I cope with them well but when I was growing up it just was rough it was very rough had to do a lot of things on my own they wasn't involved in my decisions in life you know I just I didn't know how to really grow up and be a kid and which way to go or anything is just was like I was in the world by myself yeah all is very easy asleep will every night I couldn't sleep anytime I sleep very well a little sad but most of the time I'm very happy I'm just not happy with where I am in my life right now not really I really I try to think very positive and try to do whatever I can every day to look for work and just stay positive and focused no I haven't no I haven't the last time I feel very happy was when I graduated from college I feel very happy that was one of the best things that happened in my life and that was the last time I was really really very happy like that I feel like I was on top of the world I feel like just overwhelmed with joy just everything was just so exciting for me that day I was just very very happy nothing can make me upset that day I was very happy and when I think about that day it is it's a very happy experience for me right now I don't really have a best friend I really tried to I tried to eliminate a lot of my friends because they wasn't really making a lot of Positive Choices so right now I'm just like I really don't have any friends right now my personality I'm a happy person I'm an outgoing person and a positive person and a good mother insecurities like sometimes I feel like I have a lot of weight on my shoulders or something I feel like I can't get through something I can't get to the next step sometimes or just feeling down sometimes well I did have a friend and she was like bipolar and I tried to really be your friend no matter the disease she had but she was in a really good friend because she one day she start this being very negative and just talking about me like we were enemies and everything and it didn't really make me feel too bad about myself but it just made me pick my friends very wisely yeah just being friends with turn people that don't have positive things going on with themselves or just don't it just when I notice things about people that should determine whether I want to be there friend or not you know they might have bad qualities or just some bad habits they my smoke cigarettes or drink and I should notice that that's a red flag and I shouldn't be these people friends to stay in school stay positive stay focused and surround myself with good positive people and just stay on the right track well I went to a friend's house that I haven't seen since childhood and they is it a lot of people over there and they had a barbecue and everything and I really enjoyed seeing my old friends that are then seeing a long time and just being with my family and certain friends I really enjoyed because I'm really always in the house I really don't go out that often so just I enjoyed being with a group of friends and family and having a good time yeah I'm proud that I did get my GED I did graduate and I do want to be

84,471,"okay thank you yes I'm doing well thank you from Los Angeles sports Outdoor Sports mainly surfing snowboarding mountain biking rock climbing awesome awesome traffic yes experiencing different cultures well I love going to Mexico and it's so much different from California and Western culture so to speak I know Mexico's a western civilization but the level of entertainment than the level of education is so much different than they're like two different worlds traveling you mean I would have to say going to an island off the coast of Fiji and the name is table Aurora and it's a very small island you can walk around in 30 minutes 30 or 40 minutes and it's a place where you go to go surfing and it is an incredible visually incredible and experientially incredible place I studied biology I was pushed from behind by my father who was a medical doctor and he wanted me to become a medical doctor also not at all I'm working in areas of business now yes I am my dream job would be to be a missionary yes my father's initial objective when he became an MD was to become a missionary and the he's a very generous person and I think I am too I guess I got that from him hereditarily but I would like to help people and I don't think being a doctor is helping people I really don't I think it's disingenuous to say you're helping people while you're stuffing wads of cash into your pocket I would like to be building people homes and helping them find fresh water sources things like that if I could afford to travel to remote places like that screensavers I know it's not what are you my exercise I think I'm pretty good at it. I think I'm pretty effective at it it was probably two days ago it was my girlfriend and it was about her lack of consideration I felt frustrated a situation which I wished I could handle differently in my later years I would say I don't have many regrets in my younger years I used to be snubbed by people and I would keep my mouth shut and I wouldn't say anything I would not express my displeasure of their actions or their behavior I would just keep my mouth closed and internalize my feelings I've learned that that is so wrong and so they'll probably the last 15 to 20 years I have made it a point to vocalize my displeasure with someone's actions right away and that takes care of the anger immediately yes say it depends what you mean by trouble I think all the way around once you take the beginning the beginning to the end it diffuses trouble rather than prolongs or protracts the trouble going back it would be to not to pursue medicine like my father wanted we argued at length for many months and years about this and finally I prevailed and I didn't go to I didn't go that route but that was probably the most difficult. In my life there was a time when I wished I could erase a female interactions girlfriends than and their betrayals but now I realize that keeping those memories make me who I am today and and dealing with them defines who I am today oh my parents are deceased I had very good relationships with my parents I'm very thankful for that even though my father was somewhat of a hard handed person we came to an understanding well before he died and my brothers I get along great with my younger brother but my older brother has issues he has psychological issues and they continue to plague him and to affect me also just just knowing that he's going through turmoil well I guess I really don't cope with it because he's clinically depressed and he has Suicidal Tendencies and that he's not working he's very highly educated and he really doesn't talk to me and his family is very abusive towards him it's an I'm not a happy relationship for his family yes I know I would have to say my father my father is my hero he's my model he's my archetype for what a man should be use unimpeachably honest and kind yet on the other hand he was he had high expectations of me and my two brothers how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep usually it wants my head hits the pillow I am dead asleep like a log but lately I've been having just last night I couldn't sleep I woke up at 2 and I have a feeling it's because of a diagnosis of cancer that I received one month ago with my own personal methods of handling stress I'm okay I'm probably 90% okay that 10% comes from a uninsured nurse about the future about whether I will survive this or not not really no never never oh I was either surfing or snowboarding or rock climbing or mountain biking I always experience Joy when I'm exercising at a very high level of exertion funny jovial intelligent perfectionist that's no one's asked me much about that maybe to submerge my hedonistic self I look at it once again and my father feels my Consciousness he was the ultimate dufur of gratification he put now behind him and he put what will be in the future in his sights and he never let go of that and that's what made him the self-made man that he was or as I am looking always for the present how I feel now and it's difficult for me to slog through a mile full of crap in order to get to a prize that is so far away it would be my ex-boss and he started using my last day of work when he fired me he started using a lot of profanity toward me and I turned to him and I said you cannot talk to me that way and he continue to use more profanity until I objected to it again and that's when he fired me and that still in my mind and that occurred a year-and-a-half ago anything I regret oh yeah I regret not getting married and having kids you've done anything to a boy sure I suppose I could but I think that that would have robbed me of the many opportunities I had and I took to travel around the world and experience different cultures because that's what I enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness because the United States is not the end of the world it is once you get to trouble you find out that we are not if we do not have the highest level of living in the whole world that other people think that we're the only ones that think that and I disagree that's a good one I would say I would say to just enjoy life because you never know when it's going to end and I think I've done that and I may be coming to an end soon with this diagnosis of cancer so I think I've done I've I'm happy with my life thus far I was giving a rock climbing lesson I have a part-time job of instructing rock climbing and many of these people have never done it before and they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this may have changed their lives so that was very gratifying to me I would say my Devotion to the environment I wasn't always an environmentalist but I have been vocal in the cause of being a steward of the environment because today there are a lot of people people that are polluting the environment with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septic things like that and I stand up and I have been on TV and on YouTube speaking up against these people that pollute the environment thanks for sharing your thoughts with me and you're welcome goodbye it was interesting okay with very gradually rising, very steady, very high, small pitched voice",0

back once it once or twice a year it's how does it compare to La it's it's different it's not as busy there's more things to do outdoors in the mountains on my fan for work yeah I am I love it here it took about a year before I really felt comfortable but once they got through that kind of hard year it was pretty good out here but a good time I love that I can go to the beach I love that it's warm most of the time I love that I've met a lot of people that love the Arts as much as I do the traffic just like everyone else yeah yeah this traffic and it's pretty much just traffic earthquakes not as much as I'd like it's just nice to go someplace new experience something different I want to hear that I went to Alaska couple years ago and that was really awesome I got to go fishing in the ocean and I got seasick that was an awesome but it was cool I saw a bear in real life a bear walk through a yard is really different than La was way cool English creative writing well I always wanted to tell stories so it just made sense to work on riding and somehow some aspect yeah I am to have my own TV show where I write it and everyone watches it every week and it's awesome really hard cuz there's a lot of people that have the same dream so yeah more outgoing than shy I like talking to people enjoy other people take screensaver go to the movies or turn on music dance pretty good I was at work couple about a month ago about a month ago I got mad at someone because I didn't think they were they were giving me clear instructions and so when I try to have a conversation about it they got mad and then I got mad and we got mad I felt like I wasn't being heard or listen to and felt like we weren't able to have a real dialogue so because we couldn't have a dialogue I felt like no one was listening to me totally no ragrets I yes I don't know if there is one I mean I'm sure there is but one time I was driving behind someone and they will they cut me off and I think it's just been one of those days this was like a year ago or two years ago it's just one of those days where I just didn't want or I just been a frustrating day when this person cut me off and I almost got an accident with them I just followed them to their parking spot and actually I'd haunted them and they they flipped me off and so she's really really going to my skin would cut me off and almost caused an accident and then and then flipped me off so I followed them to the spa and I asked said Miss why did you put me off when you cut me off and and she said oh you know I'm I've had a rough day I don't need your attitude and her daughter was with her and I told her well you're not releasing a very good example for your daughter and you know I didn't need to be Petty like that but I just I wanted to be a guess tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to get you going deep is the hardest decision was coming out to my mom telling her I was gay I mean it wasn't hard cuz it was the right one but it was hard to do because my mom is very conservative and she she had trouble accepting and it it took a while but when she did you know everything is better and I knew it would be but it was just hard in the moment to you know tell her something she don't want to hear when I was little kid my my grandfather found our dog run over in there on the road and he and brought it in and buy them over as a kid just like seeing death like that really just threw me off and frighten me and I was just one of those moments but like I guess I wish I hadn't been there for it because my grandmother was destroyed she was just so sad and she was woman's I guess you need as a kid but I didn't really want to experience like losses like that in your face our relationship and our family is pretty good we find out as close as most but we do know we was we don't talk often but we talked with love and we always love each other when we see each other my grandmother was very positive she was always very encouraging and told me to you know pursue my dreams and not to let little things get me down so glad I had her how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep usually it's easy sometimes it's not wife in between jobs recently I start a new job next week but while I've been off I haven't been working I tend to like my body wants to stay up later and later and later and I'm trying not to like fall into the pattern of going to sleep at like 2 or 3 and getting up at like 11 so I keep trying to make myself go to sleep by like midnight or 12:30 and I just end up laying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half and I should be I should I should be able to just go to sleep and get up at like 9 but I want to stay up I guess a little scatterbrained like today I'm a little scatterbrained cuz I I tried to go to sleep early again and I ended up tossing and turning and so scatterbrained most of the had a lot of time on my hands like I don't usually have this much time on my hands so sometimes it can be frustrating because you don't know what to do with it when you're not working I guess but yeah I think that's the question I just thought maybe a little more absent-minded than usual just lately with the the not working thing no a couple days ago when I got my new job I got hired outgoing listening attentive fun loyal Bank help I wish that I I probably should have looked better I wish I had more hair up here losing a little bit if I wish I was a little skinnier this is girdles pretty tight and you know sometimes I wish I had more money but nothing too drastic I'm okay yeah hoo when I was a little kid I was I was the fly was the fat kid and remember I was like I was going to high school and it was like the second day and I remember this guy came up to me and was like he was like pretty nice to me I thought midnight realize he'd like this like out of a movie right here put Band-Aids on my back that's it like I'm a fat cow until like like yeah like just a bunch of mean stuff and I didn't know I walked around with it for like half an hour people laughing I didn't get it and then find this girl is going to me and was like hey there's like Band-Aids on your back that's Kelly's mean things and then she just walked away she didn't like help me take them off and I remember like I couldn't get them I was trying to find him and then I just never liked putting my head in my locker and like I didn't want anyone to see me cry so I just like what made out of my locker and like pretend like I was looking at stuff my backpack but really I was going to know the crying fat kid who can get the mean stickers off his back anyting probably yeah you know I would I would try to keep trying to let myself know 2 to look at things positively and not like we would have people think about you and I spent too much time as like a adolescent worrying what people thought of me and as I got older I didn't care as much and I start enjoying life a lot more so I went to Coachella it's a music festival it was 3 days with all of my friends and my boyfriend and we we danced and me went swimming and we barbecued and we laughed and had a great time oh I guess my MyCareer humble as it may be I really stuck in La a long time when it was when like it was hard I stay I stuck around it and quit so and I'm proud that I've managed to like follow my dreams and really stay out here and try to make it in Hollywood thanks for sharing my pleasure bye bye that was fun okay with very gradually rising, steady, high, very small pitched voice",0

90,477,"okay sounds good thanksyes thanks I am well thank you how are you I grew up in Oklahoma I moved La about five and a half years ago so I used to be on the wet on the east coast and then I decided I wanted to come out here my hometown not very often most of my families moved away so I visit them but I don't actually get back to Oklahoma March Oklahoma's very different Ellie is a lot more exciting there's a lot more to do here and the ocean obviously is very nice you know that's a good question I I wanted to try something new and I've always loved the beach and I thought I also like big cities so I thought La might be a good place for me to come very it's probably one of the best decisions I ever made Kizi I think it seems kind of natural that seems like a good fit I just really like it here that's great I have a couple of roommates and we get along really well I live a couple of blocks from the beach and every day I get to walk on the beach or you know hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice I studied philosophy and political theory in government and did a little bit of English literature on the side it kind of just happened naturally I think I went to a liberal arts school and got kind of exposure to a lot of different areas and I just followed what I liked was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that not exactly I work for an educational non-profit so I work with grad with graduate students in the social sciences and Humanities but I don't actually use my philosophy background very often you know I haven't actually study to become a success coach and so I working with students has is kind of a nice aspect of of doing that but I'd really like to work with with other people so I'm not just students but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams hey it it's fairly hard I'm in the sense that you know it can be challenging for people to actually be motivated and do all the work that needs to be undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but it's also a challenge because making a living at it requires charging people money so I'm finding people who are willing to pay for that can be difficult to I'm definitely on the Shire side I'm an introvert so I'm pretty good in one-on-one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a couple of people I very much an observer so I tend to listen a lot and I'm not as engaged and I think that is something that goes it is noticed by others and it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted so I bet say and it's also challenge 10 not to be the person who introduces myself in a room full of strangers pretty good I think but I do have a temper so I can get I can get upside from time to time really it can be a challenge when I'm driving but other than that no I'm not sure it would have probably been a discussion over politics and it probably would have been a friendly argument probably with one of my liberal friends so but I actually can't remember the specific time I meditate I do that almost every day I also walk at the beach I love the ocean and I really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful and I like to read and be alone just with my thoughts so that's nice well let me think about that for a minute having a hard time coming up with anything I mean I'm sure there are plenty of things just nothing comes to mind okay I'm sorry well this isn't exactly an event it's with the dream and it's not a particularly traumatic dreams as far as dreams go but I do have it sometimes probably more often than I like so I wouldn't be upset if it even if I didn't have it and it's just a version of a dream that I think a lot of people probably have but it's usually me in school somewhere at the end of the semester haven't gone to class taking the exams know I'm going to fail and you know really unhappy about it wishing why did my studying attend class the way I should have which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now I have the stream sometimes and it's kind of frustrating and I'm not exactly sure why I mean I know why but I don't know what it applies to because it's not like I am worried consciously at least about failing things so no I don't think so at least not not that I'm aware of I feel guilty I have a brother and a sister in law and a nephew and they live on the east coast and I love my nephew he's 8 he's adorable and I when I used to live there when he was younger I spent a lot of time with them and since I've been in California and particularly in the last year I spent a lot less time visiting them so for example I saw them for week of Christmas and then I went back and I think beginning of May so it was you know for months between the the last time I'd seen them and that I felt bad about because we really enjoy each other's company and he you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when I leave and he asked when am I coming back so that some that makes me feel bad sometimes well I have a brother I'm very close to him he's younger and he's like for four and a half years younger he's married I have a nephew my both my parents have passed away so it's just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we're not that close with them with most of them on my father's side there's one brother and he's married and has if you could drive to cousins on that side then on my mother's side there are 545 other kids most of them with several children of their own so I have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and so we stay in touch a little bit through Facebook and they're a couple that I talk to you on the phone and visit every now and then but you know we're not that close with our extended family so say it well I have a lot of friends I think that have been positive influences when I came out to California and I started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place is very different from what I was used to it was a little bit challenging and she also work there so we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and we just established this really strong friendship and she's kind of I would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general and now she's moved to Vegas which is a little bit tough for me but we're going to Napa this weekend so that should be good but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when I came out here to really know anybody in a know since I'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends is really nice because we share a lot of same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know I think she kind of gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice how is your day I'm a sleeper so it's pretty easy sometimes my you know depending on how long I've been awake I can be without a little wound up and somehow got to take a little while to decompress but I usually meditate right before I go to bed and that's very helpful and I can sleep I generally sleep in 90-minute Cycles so usually six or seven and a half hours but I can easily sleep 9 hours if I have the time and inclination I usually don't wake up in the middle of the night or at least if I do I don't remember it so well I actually don't sleep very well when I travels one of the things I do for work is I travel quite a bit because I work for a company that's back East so I work from home most of the time but then I travel like one week a month and when I travel I'll take the red-eye and then I'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so I don't sleep that much it's not that I sleep poorly or badly it's just that I don't have that much time to sleep and the first day after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay usually the second day it's not very good sounds like a lot more tired and it's harder to concentrate and I don't know it just feels like more of a struggle good summerisle is an is a busy time for the organization that I work for so I'm a little I don't know stressed is the right word but you know a little anxious about everything going well this summer but in general I'm feeling pretty good really I can't I can't do anything there is one thing I am I do struggle with exercise like I like to walk a lot and I hike with friends and I have been really motivated about it for a couple of months but then I went away to the east coast when I came back I was a lot less motivated cuz I didn't really exercise when I was there and I gotten out of the Habit even though it only been about ten days and so now I'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as I would like it's okay thank you now now well he's a lot of fun and he really likes me and I really like him and we play a lot of games and talked a lot and actually doing a book club now so we're going to Skype and may God is more time with him that way but just being around him is fun well she probably say that I know how to have fun but that I can be serious and that I care about others and that I'm loyal and I'm not sure what else I think those those are probably the main things I wish I had more self-discipline so I wish that you know I could die it or eat healthier foods and not have a problem with sugar because I love to eat sugar I wish that I would not procrastinate because I've gotten a lot better about that but I still do and I can be challenging and I wish that I I don't know I wish that I was in a relationship so probably those things so the last organization I used to work at I had a boss and she was I don't feel like she was I don't think we were very compatible and she used to push my buttons or so I thought and so a one day she was really upset about something because a board member had called her up and asked her a question if she didn't have the answer and he was upset about something and it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was but it wasn't I I've been a manager for many years and I have very strong opinions about how you handle challenges with with staff members and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate I thought I meant she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel incompetent or at least that's the way that I felt about it and I did you know I tried to be very calm and said that I would take care of it and I did take care of it but after that our relationship wasn't really the same and I ended up leaving there to go back to the old organization that I work for not that long afterwards because I just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me or after we had that interactions so I heard this piece of advice the other day and or this thing and then I thought it's really profound and I wish that I had read it back then which is when you think about buying something instead of thinking oh here's this beautiful coat it's $100 I want it I'm going to buy it I don't think of it is costing $100 think of it is costing 10 times that because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it you know intelligently you would have 10 times that much money eventually so you should really think about it in those terms and I think I've been much more consumer than a saber and so I wish that I had to been more aware of that 10 or 20 years ago probably they asked me to be his god parent and his Guardian if anything should happen to them and that meant a lot to me because of it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that I was a good person the kind of person that could take care of their child should something happen to them so let's see well it wasn't really recently but in February I went I like to travel and a friend and I went to Singapore and I got to fly first class is miles of frequent flyer miles to get the tickets and so that was really enjoyable because the seats fold down to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and I also hadn't been to Singapore before so that was kind of cool to sure thank you bye hey with very gradually rising,

91,478,"okay yes all good things the East Coast for work I rarely I prefer it out here it's not as nice as the lifestyle out here I like the weather better and there's a lot of things about living here my favorite city so somewhat baby sleep what's that just stop I like to go to France a lot I like the food there and just a lifestyle the shopping that sort of thing art history and marketing avail I became interested in high school and I thought it was a good classical education and I interned a Dandy Warhols magazine when I was in high school and so that yes yes I'm pretty happy with what I'm I'm doing I do Consulting so I write marketing plans that sort of thing it's really hard about writing a marketing plan I know it's hard it's hard to talk to someone about who's not marketing it requires just knowledge of you know how it's how it how it's done and it takes several months to to do lunch well I guess I'm originally kind of shy but I become more outgoing just cuz of work and stuff I like to exercise I do hiking with my dogs we walk up and down a hill a couple times is that good I don't remember I don't know nothing comes to mind sometimes I don't I don't clean my car it might get lots of dog hair in it and I feel bad when I tie should always stay on top of that just getting to the carwash and stuff well I had a conflict with my brother and so I had to decide to have an estrangement from him and that makes the most sense in that was a difficult decision but just because of his angry behavior wasn't it wasn't that difficult but you know what it was somewhat difficult because I I love him very much so I'm not close to my family so my I don't really have one I have a Japanese friends I think the center came up I have a Japanese friend I'm very close but she's like my kind of my mother and I just met him socially I don't know nothing comes to mind yeah I think the sensor came off Ohio okay okay easy cuz I keep a regular schedule I'm just kind of tired maybe a little bit irritable a good well I'm recovering from PTSD so I sometimes feel that the PTSD and then I'll take a medication for that no it's just that it's just left over if that I'm still of the stress from it I'm still being treated for it but they don't really have any imma try not to talk about it I'm in the past but it's treated 5 years ago I was I was just very sad very depressed and so that's why things iety so I went to the doctor and they helped me that I did a psychotherapy the app for the PTSD. I don't know I guess so it's just I'm just kind of supportive because of the issues I have with my family it's it supportive to have a doctor who is supportive and yeah it just gets me good feedback and helps me to make a decision that sort of thing yeah I have nightmares about my family sometime nah I just try to sleep better I should I hide it before I go to sleep I sort of like meditate a little bit to get to be calm and then hope that that will help I do have you all the time pretty much like I am a dog's make me happy and you know my life is really happy I guess you know it's a nice person thoughtful a good friend and happy fun person I don't remember my forties now so I'm pretty happy with myself I don't mind you know I've done a lot of work on myself and in therapy and stuff so I'm pretty I wouldn't really change a lot I'm pretty happy with myself and I'm about to sound conceited but I'm I'm pretty happy with myself now oh that was that would be on my parents they're very abusive so I that I don't talk to them anymore so you know any times with them you know that they did Terrible Things today so I prefer not to talk about it I like to see well I just started reading a book I like to read cookbooks and I was just reading a book called on when French women cook and it's about a woman's relationship with different women in France in different parts of France in the end the cooking and so I'm really enjoying that book I usually you know I'm get the grocery shopping done which I enjoy I really I really like doing the grocery shopping I go to a few places and then do a bit of cleaning and dime just I relax oh yeah I would I would say to have better self-esteem cuz I just have very low self-esteem you know from being abused and so tonight I wish I'd been happier in the past and you know taking me a long time to become unhappy because dinner no matter what it what I did whatever she meant I was I was never happy in the past I was I was always in a struggling with being depressed I didn't even know why and now and I realized because of whatever then set it that it was from my parents that I'm a relationship and so my advice would be to not have a relationship that is bad for you like sometimes estrangement is the best place in abusive relationship I'm just the way I live my life the way I treat people I think you know and I I believe it that your Deeds are very important that I try to treat people in a good way and I'm proud of my work and I've made that that'll give me a job that I like a lot of flexibility and I got to do what I like and and you know people like my work and then also making my dogs really tired of them and okay thank you bye that was funny yeah and then just do this with very gradually rising, trembling, very low, small pitched voice",0

of make appreciate makes you appreciate coming home as well well you know I've Been to Spain and England and Italy different different places probably Barcelona love Barcelona the architecture and the 12th food was was a part of it but just leave my experiences there were fantastic art history I was always good artistically so it seemed the natural probably should have studied graphic design which I later got into to be the star of my own TV show I would be the most hilarious comedian making the entire country laugh at my brilliant comedic point of view on life outgoing always have been as an actor as a kind of a comedian that do the comedian as well and you have to be outgoing s'more fun try to take a peaceful walk do yoga much better I used to be with it when I was younger not so good lately I'm actually very proud of it I think the only time I really argue was on the phone with Time Warner Cable I know it's been awhile maybe not working hard enough some days when your freelancer it's hard to keep at yourself to consistently be productive well I don't know can we come back to that one I can't think right now I probably once when I moved back to Los Angeles from Boston and I had a girlfriend at the time and it was hard to leave I knew I had had to come back but I think that particular move west was what made you decide to do that felt it was calling me and that's where my connections were and I had to come home I think so yes erase for my memory I don't know which I mean I don't know something you feel guilty about maybe you know maybe doing something when your little you've had a couple of extra drinks and you made out with a girl that you shouldn't have it's pretty good I think they're challenge there's my folks together got a sister sisters in New York not the Titus family but you know what I'm grateful for everything that I'm derived from it I have a best friend that I went to college with and he's very smart I consistently call him when I'm having challenges life challenges I will consistently call this well if you specific friend to get advice and I like that I have a couple of friends who have been tremendously influential in supportive friends ER good friends are very important how easy is it for sometimes most of the time not horrible but not a may I mean it's okay dragon type not motivated or yeah pretty good pretty good no I mean there I think they're consistent with the way I've been for a while no no I think when I get consistent work when I get a lot of do a lot of creative stuff get a lot done creatively I guess I would hope something like you know charismatic fun loyal guy I wish I were more more aggressive more consistent with pursuing dreams I do a lot I do enough soon as I get down on myself for not trying harder to do all the artistic things I love to do well recently recently I signaled into a lane this woman was shouting at me I could hear it cuz our windows were open was a hot summer day and then later I drove up beside her and I said in a pleasant way I said I was just trying to signal to get into your lane and she was cursing at me through the window prior to that and she looked it up or just looked it up for finger gave me the finger and it was just it's funny sometimes you try to approach someone in just a normal loving way and all they have for you is hate and that did make me feel bad little angry no cuz I took the high road but she preferred Kretz I'm sure go out with friends make dinner recently a bunch of I had a small party at my house and one guy cooked food made a bunch of friends over and that's always fun let's see never get to Upper to down Too Hot Donut Central at the highs and lows because there's always a different it's a roller endless roller coaster so you need to be prepared for the for that long ride creative things the creative the performances the comedic performances the commercials I've done that acting the stand up comedy the graphic design all my creative

seeing I'm really into music so it's a great scene for that I don't like driving I don't know who does right it's just it's just such a drag and getting from point A to point B is just the daily need and it doesn't get any easier too many people too many people can't see your shoes yeah when I can I want when I can afford to being somewhere else not having to drive usually must places have better public transportation just mean I'm a culture junkie I like experiencing different types of cultures so that's how many places I've been to like Mexico and Italy it it's I want to go to more places I want to go to Japan so that'll be interesting and usually this is my family my mom sometimes my girlfriend sometimes my brother and we just yeah we go to Italy we spent two weeks there though I was cool yeah living next to the best gelato shop in Italy we were we were in Florence spent a spend a week in Florence that was great big very good culture there as well art studied film and digital media cuz I make music and I want to learn how to make music videos so it's someone trying to get into yeah yeah I mean I need to get a camera that's the thing but I've been with my main focus is music I studied film but my focus is music can you tell me about sure I've been playing music and playing guitar keyboard bass drums for about 12 years now and I do production and songwriting an indie rock band that's a great website I highly recommend it and it's it's mine so Shake It Up International Rockstar music producer and filmmaker director probably are going I'm just feel like it's the way to get the most out of life talking to people and learning about them and having them learn about you and care about you it's a territory yeah I do meditation and it's not really hard cuz it's fun and it it relaxes me and helps me Focus the same time which I know that that was a huge Epiphany for me that you can relax and focus at the same time cuz they're only when I'm relaxing I'm tuning out I'm focusing on something else but to be able to come by in the sensations was yeah I've been doing that for about 3 months now so yeah it is almost to get a tax sometimes others things that should be said that I that I don't just because you know it's like you're opening up a can of worms maybe one of your friends for example I got a problem with him but they don't have a problem with him necessarily so you can do anything to them and I've had to deal with that in the past sort of a awkward social situation but yeah I make deal probably argued with the guitarist for my band we had a falling-out we're not going to be in a band together and we're still friends so at least it's that but it was just basically about creative control the project and how we're going to prioritize it and in our lives and you know we just our priorities weren't the same and I got very upset so that was the end of that I felt good that it was definitive that it was no choice has been made on both parties also regretful that you know he didn't feel the way that I want him to feel about it which was excited about the project so the fact that he wasn't really in it kind of pissed me off but I got over it any I got some other people that are really really excited to be working with me even honored so you know I'm gone thank you I don't know I don't really I don't really have any regrets like that at the moment I can't really think of any when I was in high school I cheated on my girlfriend I don't think it would mean anything it's time but I did it I regret it but I you know you know life happens you make some mistakes selfishness being young and thinking it would matter you know thinking you know you only live once and you know for me it's probably for the best ultimately cuz you know I love my current girlfriend and I would never do that to her so that was that was years ago but and she was a nice girl she didn't deserve that so I got it shit genzyme I guess whether to go to college or not cuz I had some projects going in La that I didn't really want to shut off a dab and going get a manager we were playing out a lot and I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep that going or go to school and start over and I made the decision to go to school in Santa Cruz and and start a new life there for four years and it was difficult decision but I'm glad I did send that a lot of people a lot of people I'm still close with today that and we work on stuff together and all that so good I agree that is good thank you maybe I wish I could forget getting spanked in the parking lot when I was 4 by Danish babysitter you know on the abuse scale it's pretty low but it was somewhat humiliating and I I don't forget so have a pretty vivid picture of it and I'd be happier if it wasn't there positive there a sportive give me a hard time sometimes because they don't think that I keep things in perspective and terms of, to support myself even though I do it's just so you know I have a more long-range picture than they do and I have faith in myself and creative projects that I make so yeah there's a bit of tension there just cuz they expect certain things from me and I expect them as well but I just have a different way of going about it than they might prefer but they're sweet people how do I cope with them I do know what they're lovely people at their core you know cope with them cuz I love them I just no X I'll just go off on my own for a while and you know take a breather or whatever and they have everyone makes you mad sometimes so how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep challenging I just I try doesn't work sometimes I have to take medication for it at to take Ambien something like that I'm someone who sleeps in late so I always get at least six or seven hours if I have to wake up early for something I get nauseous sometimes I'll throw up in the morning yeah I've had jobs where I wake up and you know vomit while I'm brushing my teeth it's horrible it does suck its kind of something I'm worried about you know I kind of need to get some part-time work while I'm not you know getting a steady payflow for my music production so yeah it's pretty rough got some stuff I need to get over I'm not really sure how just not feeling good getting nervous when you know there's something stressful like a stressful work environment or just something that it doesn't sit well with me like being in a yeah I rushed and you know stressful work environment just unless it's about something that I care about you no like music or the Arts it's just very hard to give a shit frankly like and you know I try to psych myself into giving a shit and it just makes me sick you know maybe I'll have a Red Bull or something and your body doesn't want that in the morning it just like my body rejects things and yeah okay I've been feeling okay very very reflective for contemplative now there's going to be some changes and it's going to be some new people in my life some new people in my band and I'm going to try to push myself but try to stay grounded at the same time cuz you know I expect more for myself it's just pissing me off when I get mad at me. Basically feel like I'm shiting all over myself my body sitting on me anyway just by being so so shity yeah no yes I was diagnosed 12 years ago I haven't been in therapy since they gave me Zoloft and I don't like it made me feel worse than I do in the shittiest moments I was telling you about it it made me feel numb I don't want to feel numb I want to feel everything even if it sucks being forced to this private school they thought I was acting up I thought I was up at a kid I think I was just being a kid so yes I do well I haven't been in in 12 years but I do think that it might be helpful for me in the future can you tell me about that I thought you weren't a therapist that's a typical therapist question right there well yeah I kind of want to go back to therapy and might help might help me buy some solutions maybe maybe it's not a therapist any maybe it's a life coach I have no idea but I'll be seeking help soon yesterday I was watching a movie with my girlfriend and I looked over at her and smiled at each other and it was great yeah very honest sometimes brutally so but I'm a good guy I think they're my friends all think I'm a gay guy funny open minded I guess that's what I'm working on which is trying to improve my discipline and try to work through my body rejecting shittiness of the world it gets better stay in shape gets harder the longer you wait give up on your dreams keep doing what you're doing my music you're welcome miss talking to you with very gradually rising, trembling, low, very small pitched voice",0
95,482,"okayyes I'm doing fine I was born in Texas and I moved to California when I was three and grew up here in California I was yes I've never been back there I don't have any relatives there don't have a reason to go back there well my at my family's here that's one the weather is great the beaches and mountains are here all those things are very good the traffic was probably most people say it's expensive to live here who's probably talk to you recently I've traveled well you get to see new places in a new people you get to learn more about other cultures and different ways people think how at the end of March and went to Ecuador for a week I spent most of most of one day with with an Ecuadorian who only speaks Spanish and I speak very little Spanish so we got it was it was challenging for me trying to communicate with him felt like a little kid trying to narrow saying yo what's this what's this is very humbling you're just just saying that and when you don't we're not able to communicate that that can be very difficult I'm probably more of a shy person genetics I don't know why I'm an electrician so I studied electrical construction have also saved a computer networking it was I guess just kind of circumstances I needed the work I was doing wasn't providing for the family and I knew someone who could get me a job doing electrical work until so I pursued that because of the financial gain it's giving me a lot of opportunity but I don't think it's why I do what I want to do for the rest of my life well I'm actually pursuing becoming a missionary my wife and I are looking at moving down that Corridor in the fall for 4 years and last year we we trained in North Carolina for one year and that was like Theology and Bible training basically God put a desire in my heart to get Beyond could be on myself and and do something for other people to to go in and learn about another people their culture and to share the gospel with them all my immediate family I have my Mary have been married for 10 years this June and we have four daughters and then but I have one older brother how no sisters to what what do you want to know about my family I'm really close with my wife and my daughters are with my brother I'm not not real close partly because he's at he's mentally handicapped he has the mental capacity of a 7 year old even though he's he's five years older than me so just kind of because of that Dynamic it's hard to have a close relationship with him by I'm pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents I tell you my I use fashion high school he was a real real positive influence and me just he has a he has a drive in his heel for for pursuing the truth and just a studying the Bible in and because of his influence that kind of put me on a path to wanting to study the Bible I think I've gotten better at it there have been times when y'all get angry and yo it can just kind of really rule over me just the frustration and I'm the type of person that takes me usually it takes some time for me to get angry and then some time to to calm down again but I've I've learned over time that really getting angry and keeping that anger and doesn't it doesn't attack the other person or the thing that I'm angry at it just kind of attacks me it's a really it's not a it's not good behavior to to keep so wet when things anger me I tried to like talk to the person saying it was at this situation is making me upset try to can't talk through it and in resolving come to a resolution even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root of the problem well a couple weeks ago or made it as me being a month ago my wife and I were going on a trip with with her parents and her parents had already left it we're just driving down to Orange County area for this trip and my wife wanted what she had said expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things we packed and but hadn't really and in my eyes had Express that clearly but her eyes she had and so when I was trying to meet those expectations she knew I didn't meet him according to to what she wanted and then she became angry and so from my perspective I was doing what she wanted and kind of getting attacked for it so so that I I started yelling at her and and we know we have that conflict but then yeah we're within an hour so we kind of talked through and we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was are you asking the moment of during the conflict very ill just very angry you know you can feel it in your body part part of the anger is play the secondary response but my initial response was that on if it was feeling attacked and that came out as anger so I would think yes or no should I felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger I guess it was deciding to go hum to go toward training last year I felt the guy to put on my heart that this was something I supposed to pursue my wife didn't feel that way and I I just feel very strongly that that was something that we should pursue and but at the same time I knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it would kind of fall apart so I kind of relinquished it and I said her you know I'm not going to make you go your life if you want to go then then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll we'll look at at doing something else and not going so that that was difficult for me cuz you again that I kind of felt like a loss cuz I felt deeply that that's what I was supposed to do but then after I kind of gave that up then then she came to a point where she said no I have a piece about not doing this and I went ahead and pursuit at so so just kind of giving it up what was it was difficult for me tell you about something bad or something that I can erase my memory I miss you not sure I don't know I can't really think of anything very traumatic that I would want to erase I think you're good things and positive and good things and bad things they all kind of shape who we are and so I I can't think of anything that would want to erase usually usually it's not too bad are you referring to on the the questionnaire when I said that I had some trouble sleeping that the job a works at the kind of the scheduling a shifted so I so lately I've been working some night time shifts or graveyard shifts so coming home in the morning you know when it's light and it's been hard for me to sleep but it was it was mostly cuz I was staying up so late because of work pretty easy what I do when I don't sleep that I do get cranky I've been feeling good lately no not really no no her--no can't think of anything that was cut out of the ordinary but yesterday we my wife and I took two or three younger girls we took him to the park the oldest one stay with her grandma but we we took him to the park and they played and yeah so that those are always happy times we take the kids to the park I think you say I'm a family man sad I'm a Dependable that he can he can count on me usually might my friend I end up doing different work around the house for him cuz I'm kind of a handyman so so that way I think you say I'm kind of Dependable or someone you go to for advice I guess I would I guess I would like to be able to start conversations with people easier sometimes I have trouble just talking to people especially if they're in a group if people are 101 then it's it's usually easier for me to talk to them but kind of talking to people in a group how I wish I was a little better at that now if it's okay what was it say right before that was that if if I'm giving a speech or something to a large group I don't really have a problem with that but if it's more interaction type thing that's kind of call advisor we're going to myself turn 20 years ago I probably would have been to to go to college right away instead of going to school later in life that's about it think I'm that would have been the biggest difference in my life I think what if I have 4 Kids and I hope I'm raising him right I hope that that alarm for the mistakes that I've made I can kind of guide them through their their journey in life and I hope that they end up a little better for it then than me yeah I just hope hope kind of threw them that I can heal believe something worthwhile you're welcome

96,483,"suregood I guess New Orleans Louisiana a 2005 I used to go back often but not much anymore just think happened well I guess you're not programmed with Trina happened in 2005 not really tell me about that where to begin just has different culturally have a different culture out here it's just a different place it's it's bike-friendly Louisiana isn't New Orleans for that matter really isn't now they're trying to be but it just it isn't that successful the drivers the crazy not really kind of but not much anymore don't have the money kind of broke just being able to go on an adventure I once went to Comic-Con on a on a bicycle like on a 3-wheel bike and that was pretty fun kind of scary and dangerous new I got killed it was scary traveling or just in general I got to say I got to say we were we were heading out of we were getting off the PCH and going into Laguna I'm going to have this really steep hill and on Sundays it's full of traffic and I remember going down that the hill and my brakes weren't working and I was trying to hit my brakes and try and hit my brakes and they just they wouldn't quick and I was like oh God and I'm going to throw you all bikes on larger than most bikes and I'm like zipping in between like gridlock traffic going downhill unable to break and I'm going down and suddenly there's the car that veers right into the century where I'm trying to go so I turn sharply in front of between this bus and this truck and literally end up going sideways through traffic through oncoming traffic looping back through oncoming traffic back into the right traffic still without any breaks and like not managing to keep my bike from rolling which is painful when your bike rolls kind of hurts a lot so yeah noted various different things at Anthropologie visual effects kind of weird but yeah I've always had a fascination with film and I think the white people do things and go about things as fascinating just as like that the mob mentality of people especially dream job huh I have no idea did the job I guess I consider myself more outgoing you know I've never been afraid of what people think of me why people don't like people I don't know I'm not I'm not afraid of what they think I'm more concerned with like the people I know and what they think of me I guess so being outgoing just doesn't really affect me play video games listen to music yeah read books I like reading books and drawing reading books drawing playing video games did I forget anything sleeping I like sleeping that's fine not good and high school a I shove somebody's head through a locker yeah yeah that that's not good don't ever shut someone's head into a locker that's a great way to get suspended I don't know things like that just getting into fights like a serious argument I guess like argument over over I guess over like a like viewpoints on like that control and gun control laws I mean I was like yesterday evening it was it was an argument about you know gun control regulation I mean it doesn't really affect me personally but that was like the last argument I got into I want you specified I think my entire life I have about two years ago I broke up with like as everyone calls her my evil Acts and yeah it was just it was bad the whole the whole thing went down bad I mean I think I've calmed down a lot since then what is a person as a whole but I mean I was angry and stuff I think I like one riding my bike for like a hundred plus miles in a senior day and I was in a ton of pain like later in the evening I got home I was like oh God like I can barely walk and yeah I think running off in like going on like extreme cycling spree was not good but is better than like eating too much in like just over eating cuz I was depressed but yeah like we we fought and screamed and it was it was not good like I wasn't physically fight it was more like a screaming match of death I don't think I've had a singular hard decision I've ever had to make because my my biggest thing and why don't you know don't regret don't regret the things you do just regret the opportunities you've messed and that's like had to come with me that's like hats I've had to like learn that in the past like 2 years like two years ago I totally just cannot grasp that concept and answer your question I think thinking about it the hardest decision I've had to make is I'd say probably probably to break up with my ex probably where do I begin my ex was not a good person and just in any way shape or form of the word she did some things they wasn't entirely comfortable with just took that the people around her and to me I you know they say You're supposed to give forgive people for making mistakes or doing things and I just I think there's some things you can't forgive people for no matter how hard you try and I think there's something that wants done but they can't be undone they just their through the way that they are and I think I think after what she did I like I just did things just fell apart after that it just to spite us trying I just didn't work out I mean I don't know I don't really want to talk about exactly what happened emojis oh man erase for my memory or just erased from ever happening huh I don't you know that's hard Katrina just the experience of Katrina for starters my ex I guess between those two it's it's going to hurt at that actually rather lean towards Katrina cuz that was just that that was not I mean I guess you don't exactly know about it but in 2005 does giant storm hit New Orleans Louisiana killed a whole bunch of people level the town and I'm also at a friend's during the storm I mean I'm kind of getting over it but it's still it's still there and I think I don't know I mean you can try and look at you can try your best to try and find something positive in that but there's just there's nothing the only thing you can do is just think that was like a freak accident will never happen again I live in LA and you know earthquakes can happen I just think I'd rather rather know that it's coming then not know it's coming have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD yes yeah depression it's record multiple times that's no surprise first time I was diagnosed was in Middle School which would have been ten well ten between 10-12 years ago I don't know I don't know whenever I was in the sixth grade that's my first was told that I was depressed as far as PTSD goes post-katrina and then you know post-katrina moster that was the big thing I guess having been diagnosed previously is being depressed and still being in high school it kind of wasn't I wasn't really seeking help its kind of I got that kind of got into my high school and then we're like here's help cuz we know you're going to need it and I was like oh well thanks I didn't really ask for it but okay I'll take it you know just kind of happened no not not anymore what's a good question you know I was like I'm not going to do this anymore sometimes sometimes it's a lot of like how are you feeling today and stuff and you know it's kind of well I'm feeling fine right now but ask me in 2 hours and who knows you know I guess it's helped me understand that some of the things that just happened just happened and to just get on and move along with your life essential just like carrion you know things will happen carry on tell me about the last time you felt really happy wow I was I was hanging out with my girlfriend just hanging out for starters I mean you can't see when I walked in but I'm walking with cane right now cuz I got hit by a car recently and make my leg better what's a chainsaw over there that way but anyway I don't know I make myself less fat how to make it so I don't feel the incessant need to sleep 14 hours a day ohm kiss when you sleep like more than 10 hours a day it's just some productive if you waste too much time with guy friends who are like oh you know I feel rejuvenated after 6 hours and I'm like how do you do that I have to sleep with 12 hours to feel good when you can sleep 6 you know like in an crunch time you know you can get away with for I have to get away with seven or eight you know like that that's my crunch time sleep schedule 8 hours it's just I don't know I oversleep but I like sleeping to I'm just the oversleeping part I don't like so much utterly insane in a good way I'd really insane in a good way I guess like that they would also say like you know that there are times where I might seem like an asshole and I'm not really an ass-whole I just you know I just have issues like everybody else specifically I have Asperger's so that's a form of autism I'm not just kind of makes life awesome did also say I'm flamboyant an eccentric cuz I totally am I just I don't know I figure I'm still alive so I should live because I'm still alive do you know who knows how long I'm going to be live for so I should you know Live While I'm Alive and just go out and do stuff not not sit and be calm except when I'm reading I like reading stop fucking up know it's kind of messed up I think I would have told myself at the time because I have known my my evil acts I've known her since like I was like six and she was five I think 10 years ago I would have grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl don't trust her she can't be trusted and more importantly don't don't let your guard down around her cuz show show exploit that I don't mean like physically let your guard down not mentally yeah don't date or just don't do it it's not worth it it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain it's not worth it the fact that I'm still alive Maybe yeah I don't know cycling the Comic-Con I was pretty proud of that pretty proud that I managed to do it just I don't you know I don't really know I don't really use the term pride and I really feel Pride I'm just it's more like the fact that I'm still alive I'm proud to be alive I don't know if that makes me humble or just insane who knows do I press the button now I'll buy okay to who do do do do do by the way her eyes are really creepy just saying that it's just the way that they say that they have the uncanny with very gradually rising, trembling, low, very small pitched voice",0
97,484,"okay yes I'm doing well I was born in Oakland all the different areas of the city the different cultures that are here the traffic the lack of public transportation and the superficiality I I don't I would love to travel more being able to experience a different way of living getting outside the bubble that you normally live in and getting a different perspectives I'm in 2008 I studied abroad in Brazil and that was about four months and I was in Bahia which is in the north and see the program consisted of learning the history learning the language and staying with a Homestay family I've always wanted to travel and I chose to Brazil because they have an afro Brazilian population or large after Brazilian population which I really want to learn more about and I think their history and their culture is really interesting I think taking a bus by myself to a remote beach and just navigating on my own and figuring out where to go right now I'm getting my masters in social work dream job I think to consult about mental health and how to how to intervene effectively with different cultures and doing a research and Consulting work and getting to travel basically that those would be the main characteristics I think that's a false dichotomy but I do consider myself shy but at the same time out going in the sense that I push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone and I'm determined to do what it takes to become successful I listen to music and just lay on my bed and I guess you could say do mindfulness and really just take my mind off of things also breathing exercises which I'm learning more about as well as exercise pretty good I don't get angry a lot so as far as angry temperament I'm pretty good at that what month is this may probably two months ago and I argued via text message so it's not really intense arguing but I guess you called arguing in a sentence over whether or not I should be forgiven for something that I thought was minor with a friend I've had for a few years I felt anxious sad and angry yeah those are the main emotions I know them because I think I'm pretty in touch with my emotions and being able to identify them and then I'll notice the physical manifestations of emotions like if if my heart's racing or from getting sweaty if I'm if my breathing is more shallow I'll know I'm anxious so I'll know something is bothering me that I wish I had handled differently I guess related to this argument I went out one night and got a little too intoxicated and ended up calling a person for a ride home but that really upset that person and I know that it wasn't such a big deal but I wish I hadn't have let myself get to that point it impacted a relationship and I also felt really bad about what I did hardest decision wow probably deciding what type of graduate program to go into I briefly went to law school and decided not to do that so afterwards after dropping out I had to really rethink what it is that I wanted to do and what I wanted to dedicate my life to go into debt for spend a lot of energy on I think by recognizing what I don't want to do and doing a lot of research on program requirements and the jobs that you can get after completing a program after think revolving around the same person I've spoke of earlier it was a dating relationship and a few years ago we had a falling-out over his treatment of me and involved another person and I wish I could get that out of my mind I have a pretty good relationship with my mom she lives in the Bay Area I didn't grow up with her but I've gotten closer to her as an adult we talked pretty regularly with my dad I grew up with him mostly he lives in Atlanta and we don't talk as much but we are we were pretty soon relationship it's not really that contentious or anyting and I'm an only child so I don't have siblings I don't have a large family I'm so in general I'm not really that close to family one person is my mentor who I met in 2005 and she's a judge and I met her when I was in community college and she really open my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that I would be able to achieve certain things is it for you to get it pretty easy well it's easy for me to sleep what's not easy is getting up because usually I do not look forward to what I have to do that day and the thought of it is you know just makes me want to stay in bed all so I wake up pretty tired and not really feeling refreshed I think just self talk about how would I have to do isn't that bad or that the things that I'm doing now or going to end pretty soon with the end of the school year trying to think of things that I can look forward to in the week also listening to music and browsing the internet kind of gets my mind going feeling oh wow feeling emotionally drained in some ways and at the same time feeling like I've accomplished a lot and I've grown so mix of ambivalence and feeling drained and a mixture of feeling accomplished and proud at the same time no I haven't yes an 2006 the convergence of a lot of stressful factors I was out of touch with my mom I started why I transfer to a university that was pretty rigorous and just all those changes going on really exacerbated things that were already there depressive tendencies that were already there and it got to a point where I just felt really overwhelmed yes I do yes I notice I'm better able to accept my emotions and not judge them and also identify them I'm able to think differently about things that happen maybe look at things in a more positive light and also identify the areas I need to work on and the underlying issues in those areas this past weekend I reconnected with some old friends and it was really good to see them and be back in touch again people have different takes on on me I don't have one best friend but I think people would describe me as very analytical sensitive intelligent intellectual I wish that I did not order it I wish I was better able to cope with my anxiety and depression which I'm working on and I wish that I had more energy start going to therapy now but yeah I really would and also to what house am I playing 10 years ago 18 okay so graduating from high school I would tell myself to pick up some more job skills that I wouldn't have to struggle as much in the future and to seek out mentors to get a clearer idea of what I wanted to do as a career I think the fact that I'm in grad school and coming from the background that I that I come from low socioeconomic status and just pushing through challenges to get here thanks

100,487,"no hair is all messy Doug and she's going to start okay hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today yes I'm fine thank you Detroit Michigan yes I moved to LA myself in 2007 but my family came here many more years ago more like 40 years ago how often do you go back to your hometown I don't go back to Detroit anymore I really don't like the weather and I really don't have any reason to most of my immediate family is out here in California compared to a completely different for me Detroit was just very cold it wasn't the best for my personality I prefer La more open space warmer climate warmer people just a different different vibe that I that I like better after my husband and I relationship ended I have family out here so I thought it would be easier to start over here than some of the other places I have lived or just stay where we were at extremely easy I came out here every year to visit while I was in college so I was extremely used to it plus I had also taken 6 months out of off of school and lived out here and it went to school out here so I was completely used to it like I said the weather is number one and just less crowded it's more open space it's a comer friendlier Vibe less rushed this morning would be one and when I drive to traffic in certain areas it can be but in general there's not a lot but I don't let's like I guess the overall threat of earthquake but that's isn't really that much of a factor cuz it rarely happens the price of real estate that's another one that I don't necessarily like I'm sure you can tell. I can't see your shoes I can't see your shoes at all so I don't travel as much as I used to but I have traveled worldwide new experiences well I used to be an international flight attendant and then later I traveled through my work as a cruise line and as an international sales account executive so I traveled a lot of different places and how to say they were all pretty much enjoyable cuz you know there's different cultures different things to see do learn enjoy experience my experiences I was saying Europe visiting more so I've also visit it in South South America yes cuz our cultures are so very different I was probably say more shy in general compared to people who I know are really really outgoing although I've had them describe me as outgoing what I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got I like to read I like to walk or power walk or hike listen to music I'm very good at controlling my temper oh probably when I was married with my husband many years ago it could be many things I don't even know a specific but just anything in general pretty much could turn into a debate argument with him it could be it could be your choice of some of the instances when I might have been with him and I you don't got emotional or let it bother me that he made such a big deal of something rather than just you know saying it is not something to respond to perhaps but it was always be where you were also pushed to answer so you know you can always just say ignore a person there cuz many times it's just a matter of ignoring situation and it doesn't escalate but some people you know what don't respond to the so-called Norm if you ignore it they'll just so you know deescalate but that's not always the case I taught middle school kids and you can try call message with him but that doesn't always work but you always have to use the teacher maintain you know your professional demeanor so you can't really even when you know the kids do something outrageous or possibly dangerous to themselves or the kids so well if I could be several my guess it is Susan in long as my mom deciding to let a relative have surgery that you know the outcome was uncertain it could go either way and in that case she died so I know that's a pretty hard decision cuz you don't know but you also know if you don't but it could be very serious outcome for them as well what about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase her memory oh many different things that could occur you know in life you always are second-guessing things that you might could do but they also can be learning experience is so is it necessarily a good thing to erase them you know if you can look at is positive sometimes people can have a strong reaction and don't really look past the impact of the event cuz there might be something that you can gain from that but there are a I grew up in a home of dysfunction so there was just domestic abuse you know and there were many incidents is so you can't just say only one cuz there is lots of traumatic things but it also would have been a different outcome and say learning to deal with some of the things that occur in life is an adult that sometimes I see among the acquaintances or friends that have not had really strong experiences fall apart or just have very very difficult times dealing with so you can listen you know you can and I cuz I understand that not everybody's had the same experience you know you can walk them through levels of understanding and you know as you know someone you have a balance of background information on which to help them pull from in to see that you know things will progress in a better way knowing that this isn't like the end of the world or is terrible as it seems that it could be and you can also relate other experiences of things at work worse or you know seem to be and of course is always in general I mean when you look at all the calamities in the world you know most of those things aren't affecting us or the people that we know here so that provides as perspective that you know can pull someone out of there I don't necessarily say self-absorption but the seemingly intensity of their experience right at the moment well we have a good relationship day for the most part there are different levels of stress and Trauma that some of my siblings have experienced so it is made them interact with life and people you know more intensely than others some of not had as much experience in life that will help them deal with things you know in a different way so it's always evolving and I walk and positivity as a lead of you know the way I respond to try and engender more positive response from them rather than feed sometimes the very strong reactions are responses or any reactions that they may have pardon I didn't I didn't hear you could you repeat my mother different teachers friends can you tell me about well my mother is always been a very calm person for the most part easy-going even though she's experienced a lot of negativity I've had teachers that have been very talk positive and proactive and have you know taught independent thinking and techniques to rise above some of the things that were occurring and just very close friends that you know I would see handling situations sometimes more much more more difficult you know dealing with things so it depends for the most part it's you know pretty good it depends if I'm dealing with a lot of things or studying or you know trying to get more hours in the day cuz me to get things done then you know it's less but in general I don't have a problem sleeping it's just if I make myself stay out stay up because there's more stuff that I want to get done I've been feeling okay but less you know stressful and general it goes in general cuz I've got several projects that I'm working on so but in general good like I mean. In particular I mean I just seems less stressful as I get more stuff done and the stress comes from sometimes are being a lot more things to do in a short. Of time but you know reorganizing some of the things that need to be done you know can smooth it out have you ever been to no I haven't but I know it's something that a lot of say veterans are particular how people have I have not know well there's several I guess and happiness comes in small or large things but in general everyday everyday everyday every moment to me is I mean every day every morning is great wonderful you know your happiness as far as big celebratory kinds of things I don't have big highs and lows like that I think it's something that should be on your Continuum you know it everyday it can be a really great meal it could be a great view it could be you know a moment shared with someone you know so this should be an even on an even keel as perseverant you know I will continue for sand and positive upbeat is there anything you regret maybe not doing things differently when I were younger or like spending my money differently or or spending my time you know a little bored differently but that's hard to say it's like okay as your kiddos or you can see you know you could have done some things differently instead of buying the house I did what if you know waited and bought another one of me things like that I would have made myself moved California sooner and I would have instead of buying the house that I bought then if I known I would I would have you know the situation I have now waited to get something different but you know how can you you know how that hides out you make the best decision that you can After Time with the best information available you know after you have looked at several options being independent and educated able to take care of myself thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.

101,488,"okayyes fine San Fernando Valley I'll I really like the culture of going to museums and being able to go at night and having lots of people around it's spread out a lot and it's a pain in the ass to have to drive everywhere and that have a good public transportation system I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot and that really like to go camping but I don't really travel I think I might have been around 6 months ago I went on a trip with a geology class yeah it was fun I think it's tough to say well I think the first time I went camping was probably really memorable I went to Death Valley and I got to see a lot of really cool things and hang out with my friends at night philosophy yes I don't know I think it just sort of happened I wanted to be a journalist for a really long time and then I kind of grew disillusioned like that and I liked all the different ways are all different things I could do with philosophy I don't know but I really like children and I really like cutting their behavior so I think something along those lines might yet I think I'm generally pretty outgoing I can't be shy on my family but when I'm around friends and stuff I I think I'm pretty friendly I'm a lot of times I watch TV or read I think I'm pretty good I don't really get mad I try to think about other things if I start getting mad or I just started trying to focus on my breathing the last time I argue with someone else probably with my boyfriend and I'm having trouble remembering what the last thing we argued about was I think it was I wasn't feeling very well and I was having trouble deciding whether I wanted to go to his Department's end-of-year party and he was getting frustrated which I thought was very inconsiderate cuz I wasn't feeling well to begin with well I felt like he wasn't really taking my feelings into consideration and I really hate when he gets stressed out or I gets angry easily because I just see necessary and it stresses me out I think a lot of times when my oldest youngest brother when my oldest little brother does something wrong I tend to be harsh with him we're not as close as my sister and I or my youngest brother and I and so he tends to be hostile back and I think that if I were little bit more gentle might be easier to communicate with him when I was 19 I came home travel party I think around 4 a.m. on a Sunday morning and my. Get really mad at me and yelled at me and said a lot of that very nice things and then he didn't speak to me for about a year I want my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that I don't live at home I used to be really frustrated with her all the time cuz she has a really quick temper but I think now that I've got a little bit more just so I can see that she does the best she could and I love my siblings I again my little sister and I get along really well she's 4 years younger than me and when when she was around 12 and I was around sixteen was really difficult cuz she a really harsh time for her and she was always Moody and I wasn't in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff so we fought all the time but we don't anymore and that's really great and we get along okay with my my older little brother who's 15 and I think I'm going along pretty well with my youngest brother who's 12 one of the first not the first part one of my first Varsity professors and I really loved her classes and it was really good I'll being in class with a professor who really cared and who really engaged people that was really motivating since not all my classes were like that I think it's pretty easy I mean sometimes I have trouble going to sleep but I thought that it's I think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning well I'm really tired I can get grumpy but I think usually I'm just groggy good I'm a little anxious about about getting a job and I'm going to be taking for my school about it's only one class so a lot of free time well I mean it's not the end of the world if I don't get a job but I know that I will eventually so mostly I think I just try not to think about it too much and I tried not to be pessimistic no no well I think last time I felt really happy I went to a party with my boyfriend Matt and does apartment party and I wasn't you know I knew a couple people they are so I felt comfortable but I love that also able to meet new people there a couple kids there a special on the pool and a couple of drinks and ate some food and it was fun I'm sure probably say that I'm smart pretty intellectual I love to read and to watch really like series films and TV as you're probably all state on fun cuz we like to go out and have fun a lot well I can be really just organized and the packets me in trouble sometimes it will so that's a major loan then and procrastinating tell me about a time when someone I got into a little bit of trouble of few months back and have to go to court and was given 60 some hours of community service and of course I procrastinate and I'm doing that so I have to show up to court again to get an extension and the judge was very mean and he didn't seem as she yelled at me but it didn't seem like he gave it much thought it seemed like it was just a little less talk speech he gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at so I understand cuz that's his job but it was not great for me cuz I wasn't I was really anxious in that situation well I would have been 12 + 2 I think I think I would have told myself at 12 not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents cuz I think I was a little selfish and self-involved II I can't really think of anything I regret how I treated my mother when I was a kid but everyone does that and I do regret a couple of semesters ago I didn't do so well in school and I got a few W switch I now have to work to get off on my transcripts I think so I am I think I wasn't focusing in school at that time and I didn't see any counselors at school or anything so I definitely couldn't find that I think I probably spend my ideal weekend sleeping on Saturday and then going hiking or maybe just going to the duck pond by my house and feeding and Jackson picking some oranges and then maybe going out to breakfast Sunday and just like window shopping maybe watching a little bit of TV well-met youngest brother is autistic and my mom and dad were always working when he was growing up I'm 10 years older than him so and being the only size of us took care of him which made me really really patient because he was a handful but I'm really proud of how she turned out and and how close we are with very gradually rising, very trembling, very low, very loud pitched voice",0

Aggravated so I don't have to be aggravated I'm pretty good at controlling it sometimes but at times I can get very irate so I'm working on that right now do I have an argument almost a year but when I did it was over a girl that was my ex boyfriend it was over female but it's over now so I haven't had any real argument since almost a year I studied in college I did a child of element and I also study computer science right now I'm a homemaker I don't work at all I haven't been working in about 3 months now was laid off but I was doing receptionist work so I'm currently looking for employment at this moment my dream job is all my own design Graphics computer shop which means I'm when you do your you grab your designs online and you send them to different distributors and what they do is they approve or they approve or disapprove what you put they like or dislike about the design so they went ahead with it they'll buy them for me and then they'll go from there I don't know I used to in the past but not at the moment when I was with my daughter my mom it was very delightful we stay from was 2 weeks and it was not even two years ago it was very very nice and I wish I can go back to the beaches for beautiful the food is great the blue owls are great at night it was really really nice a great experience very close to my mother and my daughter were all three were like sisters we can be any closer my parents my grandparents who have now gone there if they're past but they were a very positive influence in my life my guy friend that I'm dating now he's very positive in my life

something wasn't right about me yes I do yes I do it's very useful it is very much so reason why I feel like it's helping me is because the lady NYC there the therapy place she's very nice she she's willing to help out in any way she can she's almost to be like a psychiatrist she's very good I mean she talked to me about things encourage me to what not to do what you do to help calm down to feel better and she's very nice or all-in-all I always leave their confidence all the time number one of my mood swings I've noticed a big change in that and my attitude affected me in a great way I would never say negative because I like like I said it goes back to the helpfulness after scene from The Lady and I'm a therapist and the different ways I was coached on how to improve my lifestyle to avoid the problem that I do have right now or suffer with so that's how it affected me that way the attitudes and mood swings can't sleep at night depressed all the time no outside company at all didn't want to be bothered with anybody friends or family locked up in my room all the time halfway not wanting to eat or overeating it was just a lot maybe like any little thing would trigger me off like somebody say something wrong to me that I would think was wrong it would just figured I would just get triggered and just snapped for no reason it's just I don't know what would cause it besides that well now I'm doing I'm coping with it by not snapping his medicine just trying to stay calm and I just need a lot of positive environment around me not negativity that helps to so with that being said I just kind of maintain and keep my high self-esteem up is As much as I can a lot better than before yes I have very positive thoughts very positive behavior much better than what it was very big improvement from before yes I have been for the past few months I've been feeling a little better I have at times but today no I'm feeling pretty upbeat it's not very easy but I try but for the past

opposite I consider myself an extrovert enjoy reading get a glass of wine perhaps throw on an old movie try to get out of the apartment and maybe take a walk something like that cruelty people not using their people being careless or thoughtless you know not really giving consideration to other people when they knew things usually vocalize my annoyance like unless I figured would be really inappropriate in the moment but I'll usually let somebody know as gently as possible then I'm kind of annoyed with what's going on usually pretty good but I also you know there's like a limit point where I go past and it's like that I cannot control it really anymore so I have a long fuse but hadabah large amount of dynamite there sometimes I had an argument with my girlfriend recently and it

bills and let me continue living on the west side I what I really wanted to do was to produce films so that was sort of my concentration in the film major and I did a couple of internships for production companies as an undergrad end in in my master's program and I like working with creative people and developing stories and developing projects and being the person that can go from the business and legal people to the creative people on try to make everyone happy and make some money I tried to I mean I'm a little low on funds right now but I really enjoy traveling I drove cross-country when I moved from Philadelphia to La so I drove down the east coast to Savannah then all through the South and the Southwest I've been to England four times I've been to Continental Europe twice lot of the islands Montreal it's only place I've been to in Canada but a lot more of the US and also Asia Africa Australia those places I've not been to yet but I'd love to go what's a may be the first time I ever left the country first time ever went to Europe we got to take the train to Glacier Express through the Alps in Switzerland and was unbelievable with the snow and things like that and I took a lot of pictures and I don't know if it's one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen so really sticks out in my mind I'm very close with my parents I talked with my mom on the phone probably two or three times a week I just talked to my father for Father's Day the other day and you know he always he sends me emails of news things that you found interesting or stuff that's related to film and things like that so I'm close my sister like I have a niece and a nephew on very close with them I talked to my sister a decent amount and I always see them when I'm home for the holidays but they're all in the Philadelphia area so I'm I'm not physically around them only maybe once a year twice at the most if there's a wedding or something like that there's been a lot definitely my parents some of my teachers in high school and that sort of encouraged me like my social studies microcultures Professor my one of my English teachers my phone program I did a summer internship program twice and they had one of her professors for my film 101 class like was the moderator for that so kept in touch with him as well I like it a lot better now my last roommate was only you somebody from the MBA program also was a year behind me and he was a terrible roommate he just moved out so I was replaced by somebody else who is Young and nice and he has the money for rent and he has a rabbit and he's just like he's a pretty cool guy so got a decent-sized place I've got the bigger bedroom of the two and the rent is not too bad and I get to live like in Culver City Mar Vista side of town which I really enjoy so I like where I live and the rent is not bad for the neighborhood not at all but a little broke right now so I got to get back working again and and calm down the the money situation but the living situation itself is fine I have one roommate yes no I have not yes well I mean I guess in college I was seeing a cognitive therapist for a while but I've never medication anything like that and I kind of got away from it but last summer but about a year ago, came back and I was being the individual counselor at school I was doing group counseling sessions and they had me on Wellbutrin so I guess a year yes I had a DUI which you know all of my drinking I think was really predicated more about the depression not being able to handle that properly so that was part of it and then just the stress of school he was having problems they're having problems in my relationship and you know is that okay really low point and I felt terrible so I decided I should probably do whatever I could do in order to get better okay not took a leave of absence from school so that's not really available to me but I still go to like a surprise sobriety support group and you know if they're going back to school to possibility so I might John go back to doing the counseling sessions there but my health insurance runs out in like two months so I don't really have I won't really have a way to see someone unless I see Department of health or something like that so we'll see I definitely think that there people that are probably on medication that are not in therapy that probably should be I'd rather do therapy without medication the medication therapy that is for sure so I definitely think it's a it's a positive to speak with something on a regular basis who is sort of removed from your life and objective about it and don't just listen that's really the most important part is I'm coming to listen yeah me just having dedicated time of like an hour or so you know 50 minutes whenever two or somebody gets to listen to what's going on with you and and offer some possible guidance in that direction you know in the direction you want to go I think is always positive and force you to be like more mindful of what actually bothering yourself when you have to vocalize in and tell them what you're feeling and try to help figure out why and what you can do about it I think that's always a good thing that my mood has been a lot better that was a really down black time that last oppressive. So it's been a lot more. Like the future and what I'm doing and the way I'm thinking about things and it supposed to just like stumbling through an existing I'm like trying to think more about what I really want to in what I believe in the things that are healthy for me and all the stuff in the should be should been doing before but wasn't I'm settling in for the Moon I wasn't drinking often but when I was I was drinking to get drunk I was very very down there was some weight gain I was sleeping a lot to enjoy as much and I was worried about money I was worried about where with recommend I decided which I still am to an extent but it's not like bringing me down so much now caught up in a down. Like a rut that I couldn't get out of I think it was probably just not feeling successful in the things I wanted to do and I just got swept up in the day-to-day of like oh well I don't have a job and I don't have any money and I'll try to figure it out and I'll do this interview and that's not going to really delete anything and it was just a very you know I wasn't moving anywhere wasn't I was stuck in one spot like that about not drinking I'm just to let you know try to be a little bit more mindful of what I'm doing and why I'm doing it you know if I get if I end up in back in school again I'm going to definitely take up the counseling sessions again I don't know if I want to be back on medication I don't like that was good for the time frame it was in but I don't have to become everything or just good I'm trying to get back in shape now I join the gym and figure that's going to help me to but the main thing is going to be figuring what to do my life cuz I'm 30 now so I feel like I'm to get the real career started okay just really worried about the money situation because I don't have the student loans to fall back on anymore and stuff so I'm pretty broke pens doing it again nice probably more positive now I would say in general I still love that The Temper switch like I'm I'm still on the same things that bother me in the past still bother me but they're not permanently like getting me down there just I would be upset about something in the moment and need to express that and then figure out a solution or Let It Go as opposed to staying in that funk so I can more resilient definitely yeah most of the time like I said if I do get upset about things I'm not somebody who likes to keep things inside but even getting Mountain Pass wouldn't really get me through them you know would be something I'd really have to slog through it would take me down for sure but now I feel a little bit more comfortable with feeling I'm feeling and getting a house and then trying to work through it some days I do you know but it's not everyday and it's not like for no particular reason anymore I mean I may be down because I'm stressed out cuz I have such a problem that you know I need to address in the in life like my lack of funds right now and you not trying to get in bad shape and you know trying to figure out what to do with my education that I have so far and find what I want to do like that something that people should be worried about but I don't feel like it's any anxiety or anything like that as we know our sadness or fear is dominating anymore how is your day I'm usually okay I've been going to bed later and wake me up later and since I've not had a job so that is something I need to watch out for cuz I really need to start waking up earlier in order to apply for things and go you don't meet people in person and try to figure something out on the job site of things but I'm I'm sleeping okay I'm not being Sleepless or anything like that there are definitely some days where I feel like staying in bed sometimes but physically I feel okay that sucks I mean I've definitely I almost feel like I've liked cold symptoms 5 only get four or five hours of sleep or something like that I won't know the runny nose I'll feel a little feverish I'll be hungry at weird times like I'll just be very run down and I did I don't like that feeling at all I try to get likes every 8 hours sleep every night probably when I was home over the holidays for the holidays I could spend half my parents and my niece and nephew and my sister and I got to see some of my old friends I got to see some of my extended family generally good feeling and is also my mom's birthday on the 27th of December so that was a fun occasion as well I would say very intelligent very funny a little bit too intense a little bit crazy but nobody loyal also generally a a good person a nice person I work a lot of things in my life I've done some things like that to you I definitely regret that you know I dropped out of the first college that I went to cuz things are really going badly for me at that time and I kind of regret that I think it might have been the right thing to do but I wish I would have been nice to be able to finish school you know on time and start a career that way you know I generally try to behave the way I would feel couple sleeping at night after work but you know everybody fails it something so anytime I've lied any time I've caught something any time I've felt like I've wasted an opportunity she's inquisitive with very gradually rising, trembling, very high, very small pitched voice",0

So I like to be like another applications editor yeah travel a lot I'd like to travel I've tried before one of those memorable experiences I I'm pretty close to my family back out here to be closer to them about 2 years ago from Chicago and so I'm closer to them now, but I don't know it was kind of a mistake professionally cuz I haven't been able to get anything going out here and so I probably should have stayed in Chicago I'm sick and I'm sorry I don't really understand I'm pretty well Chicago it was fun over there was working as a grant writer and we're there for grad school but either dropping out of grad school but the finding work has been over 5 years I like it alot Mallory situation I'm okay with it right now I'm living with a relative it's it could be better but right now is like right now but employed and it's like I said anything to me stay rent-free and so I'm okay right now before I'm at but I really do need to find another job so I can I get myself stabilized yeah I'm living with my uncle and you know like I say at this place and so he's kind of eccentric I don't know how subscribe them he's pretty out there but anyway he's okay guy do I have a source of what I'm sorry do I have I can really barely hear what you're saying and it's hard for me to understand you sometimes but I'll wait for you to answer me or ask me a question no I haven't no I haven't but I've awesome felt oppressed but I never had a diagnosis of depression I've been feeling good lately I mean relatively I mean I prefer being unemployed and feeling like really angsty over that that's you know I'm in a position where I can you know you know I can't sort of like survive out here which is important and and I'm not homeless which is important so I feel okay I mean yeah I could be doing a lot better on the other hand I'm not on the streets and things could be much worse no I haven't I'm not sure what the question was if I'd like to send some kind of therapy I've been in therapy before but it hasn't I don't know I was supposed to be there people like the therapist and I wasn't like really it didn't really help me out so much like a slight work at my issues but I enjoy talking to a therapist and I guess that's kind of like a pair of the whole situation to to the scenario talking to a virtual human that you just have someone to sit with for a while he will listen to you it someday I could be very soothing Melody I feel that way often well do I feel like I need to talk to someone very often sometimes I mean yeah I do like repressed emotions like man the pretty much I assumed I could ever become black holes with someone I would have someone I can share my thoughts and feelings with butts I was like I guess you can say I do feel what's the word I feel lonely but not lonely but like for a self contained within what's the word within my own sort of sense of self my own feelings and I don't really have a need to reach out as much because I'm a practice God I practice meditation and I totally totally helps me like next to retreat into myself in lights are like fine fine serenity serenity through a lack of desire and soap that helps me with I mean I guess I could loneliness but also I mean maybe it was like you know it like a problem I actually don't reach out to people as often as I should but I definitely neglected relationships because of that and it may all be as like self-centeredness you know but I'm trying to oh yeah this is a good one I want to try to find a way to Lake engage with people without like really allowing myself to let them down so to speak and so that is one of the things that inhibits me from reaching out to people is the idea that I could that I could potentially let them down if they were to place their faith in me or the trust in me and so I'm very reluctant to do that go on how easy it is for me I don't really again I'm only hearing part part of what you're saying and so this is going to throw off my answer I would say it's very easy I mean I can't really like I don't understand the question for Quan what I'm I think I said it would only was afraid of probably most afraid of oh my God being a failure or not being a success finding a stable job not being able to I mean settle down and essentially ain't getting married it's um I don't know I am okay with being single I'm not okay with being jobless I'm so it's like one of those things that's just like I just I don't feel I can reach out to people so because I don't have a job and so I got to like bring them into my mic my life so right right now I'm not in position to like a people I mean they have a lot of friends with us because I can't like really go outside and they can so you know spend money at and restaurants or in clubs or whatever so I'm going to buy to a lots and I think a lot so I meditate a lots and I read a lot of literature I want to go to my felt really happy well just last weekend that was set my my aunt and uncle's 50th one of your anniversary and it was a nice occasion it was really it was not their whole family was there are friendly was there and like my own parents 50th anniversary is coming up 50/50 years together and I felt really happy for them I felt really happy that I got both of them and provided us with like a really a really great childhood and it seems strange I guess I put that kind of starting point but that's something I mean I guess like suit to be floundering right now but I feel happy for the I think I guess locations like that are probably could become rarer on his light on a societal level but that some sort of like Beyond Leon sort of like Realm of happiness and anyway this weekend. I'm on the road on a bicycle and going pretty fast how are your best friends my best friend actually she would describe me as depressed all the time and I asked her about this and he's like I swear if it being around me I had brought her down at all because she was going through her own like for a deep depression that I was kind of trying to coax her out of that but it sometimes myself and so I asked her if you're around me brought her down at all and she said no it's it made her that I had liked it but I take an interest in her but what's the word let's would like my sort of like my depression wasn't like really the net didn't have anything to do with her depression it was completely unrelated to like how I felt and feel like I don't know in both cases it was just good to have someone else to be around who had some respect for like it's like how we felt or like alarm useful sort of like lack of feeling and I can put it that way and so has being brave I seem very depressed all the time and she's my best friend at this moment anything I regret all right thank you goodbye hello and goodbye hello it was kind of interesting as like I should have like told you I had like my ears are kind of kind of clogged and so I had trouble like during her at some at some point with very gradually rising, steady, high, very small pitched voice",0

find thank you where are you from originally Boston Massachusetts things you really like about a leg people first and foremost I'm very involved with the veteran community and I'm a chaplain answering my 52nd year things you don't really like traffic but that's true anywhere I see what you mean do you experience do you experience virtual traffic what do you enjoy about traveling the experience is the food the culture travel to 44 countries in my career I'd like to hear that one of your trips I was stationed in Paris France and travel to France Spain Morocco live in Germany is part of my chaplaincy service it was unbelievably exciting visiting SEC liqueur in that my Mart in Paris on my first day in France in Europe I graduated with a degree in Psychology from Boston College what do you do now I'm retired but I'm still very active as a volunteer at the prison in Chino women's prison and I can deck services at Jewish community that I stablished 51 + years ago what's your dream job actually I've been living my dream job since I was 17 years old serving in the chaplain city as a Jewish chaplain is what I wanted to do from the time I was early five or six years old I want to become a rabbi you consider yourself more shy or outgoing quite outgoing why because I'm able to be dropped into a room of 500 or a thousand total strangers and get to know them and have them get to know me without discomfort I'm divorced I was married for 16 years I have a daughter my she's been there at the light of my life my entire life I have a brother and sister-in-law and living back in Boston my parents are deceased sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got I actually have a fish tank and aquarium and instead of turning it on and seeing Virtual Fish shine watch the real thing I also like to go fishing deep-sea fishing I'm able to do that quite well when was the last time you argue with someone I would say it was a several months ago and it was about language dating someone and I thought her language was inappropriate and at first I thought I would say nothing and then I decided I should tell her what I was thinking and so I did that you wish you would handle differently the last time I saw my former wife she has created some legal problems for me and I was not as polite as I might have been I felt she was totally wrong and out of line it's been a very difficult and acrimonious divorce took 13 years to resolve that I in the last few years have not spent as much time with my daughter I was quite ill and ended up having open heart surgery and that was time when really she was abandoned I was always there to be buffer between my former wife and my daughter and when I was suddenly taken ill took me about two years to really become healthy again and during those two years she had to fend for herself from the ages of 15 to 17 difficult time for a daughter to be on her own with the mother who not as as nurturing as one would like that was the hardest decision ironically was going to do I have the surgery now and try to save my life knowing that I would be abandoning my daughter abandoning in the Lesser sense of the word we were still in contact but I couldn't be there to run interference for her or put it off and maybe suffered the consequences so I I made the decision to have the surgery tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory the only real negatives in my life have been in connection with the divorce I never thought I would be divorced I always wanted to be married and have four children and the white picket fence now I got married and I had a child and had the white picket fence actually built it but that was the toughest thing for me adjusting to divorce I never thought it would have I nobody in my family on either side has ever been divorced yes I was in the air force during Vietnam War how old were you when you join the military 17 I was going to go to Hebrew Union college-jewish Seminary in Cincinnati Ohio the war was raging in Vietnam and there was a need for chaplains and I was asked if I would serve and so I did and I originally thought it would be two years and then it was three and it was a four and then they had more time shows for years and two months I don't regret a day of it unfortunately I served in Europe not in Vietnam I was never shot at I never had to kill anybody but I really enjoyed my military service why'd you decide to enlist in the military why do they say to do what why do they say to go in yes going into the military was an opportunity for me to travel the world and do what I love doing and I've continued doing it for the rest of my adult life did you ever see combat never not a day but it was the luck of the draw when you put on the uniform you go where the government send you I could have just as easily been shipped off to Vietnam about 55 of the 60 people with who like trained went to Vietnam and fewer than 50 returned very high mortality I'm sorry to hear that how easy was it for you to go back to civilian life very easy because of the type of service I had it was as close to Miller cech's civilian life is one cat have started a business ran the business and while I continued as a volunteer chaplain and I've been doing that I still do it

But I'm the only one out here my family lives on the east coast and in abroad so but with technology it's easy to communicate with the email Facebook Skype so even though distance wise separated it's pretty much easy and free to stay in communication I know it's not whatever like to yeah I just to relax and avoid stress I go surfing big stress reliever I go surfing and it's pretty intense pain can be dangerous and that relaxes me cuz what I'm in the water and when I forgot whenever I was stressed out about enough looking it up screensavers going to do it for me I got to do something physical I'm going to control my temper I'm I'm a very controlled person so I'm not you know for real for my buttons to get pushed they really have to get pushed so I don't even have a temperature control so it's not even an issue oh probably politics are you over politics you know the current administration his opinion versus my opinion oh there's probably met a situation handled differently I don't know that would probably be something related to relationship personal relationships Damien I feel guilty about push-up guilty about probably having wasted you know I feel guilty what I waste time what I accomplished nothing and I waste time that makes me feel bad soccer question hardest decision I've ever had to make probably breaking up with a girl that breaking up with a guy with a girl yes 22 23 22 23 I wanted the action the excitement there is a war a conflict going on and it seemed like the right thing to do with the time and it seemed like that was more of an important thing to do then yes it in a job working are you happy yes I would do it over again a little it was easy I mean the transition was easy after I made a transition by going to graduate school after the military to ease into that transition and that was a that probably made it easier than going right for the military right to civilian life so I had a transitional phase for several years started working go after the military I'm sorry after the military went to graduate school and then I started working I wouldn't say it change me because it probably just fine-tuned whatever I had I was an officer and so you can't let go in and you're not going in when you're 18 you're going in after college so you got to have a little bit of discipline to go in and especially the branch that I went in so it didn't radically change me it just basically you know fine tune me you couldn't go in if I maybe if I wanted 18 it would have been something different but it did just fine tune me no there's nothing to be sorry about fun but I've been feeling fine I give you stress just looking anything but I intend to have a good way of managing stress cuz I guess I'm used to the stress so I can guide have learned to manage it well Troy study changes in my behavior enough love you hey I'm pretty consistent so like my behavior is radically changed music for you to get a good night sleep that that's hit-or-miss sometimes it's easy and other times extremely difficult so I'm Hit or Miss. I wouldn't say it's always easy for me to get a good night's sleep but hit or miss so it's like every night I can't go to sleep but I if I work out enough and surf enough I'm tired enough that I just sleep regardless so I guess it would say it's moderately easy for me to get a good night sleep if I exhaust myself appropriately otherwise I'll have too much energy too much on my mind that I'm able to go to sleep if I worked out enough surf for 4 hours 3 hours literally I'll be so exhausted that I have no doubt I'll fall asleep on the couch so if I don't I'll have a lot of energy and I'll get antsy and I have a lot of thoughts going through my head when I'm laying down at night. It'll be hard to go to sleep because too much stuff is racing through my head so what I got to do what I didn't do what I need to do I don't sleep well I just I'm probably I wouldn't say I'm like you're the bull I'm not an irritable person but I just feel like crap so I'm probably not as happy when I don't sleep well can I get a good night sleep and my body feels like crap if I don't get a good night sleep you tend to eat at me personally I tend you eat worse when I don't get a good night sleep I don't feel as good physically no felt really happy plus I felt really happy but I got an answer the question probably don't know about a month ago I when I caught a really good big wave I felt really happy when I cut this big wave surfing of course it is absolutely yeah I'm never upset or pissed off when I'm surfing I'm very happy when I'm surfing if I catch a big way very happy funny extroverted a lot of energy oh yesterday I can say surfing again but I'll keep repeating myself yesterday I went to Hollywood do a independent bookstore where they had a book reading and I was kind of cool oh yeah like my achievements that I was in the military Maya physical abilities I'm very proud of so I've worked hard to be able to yo I do what I can do surfing and other things I'm a very good athlete I'm proud that I'm a very good athlete cuz I worked hard to be a good athlete yeah.

118,617,"wow okay I broke it not so good okay all right questions and then when she's done she should say goodbye and you can press this button okay okay should be how good yes I'm doing pretty good originally I was born in Denver Colorado I like the beach sunshine pretty girls the ocean other things smog excess amount of people in traffic that can be dealt with I would like to travel more seeing new things and and learning perhaps if you culture or something oh okay I when I was younger I went to Europe and just did the backpacking thing backpack around Europe for a little while and it was it was real fun I'm probably just being in the military with some friends and stuff like that why have a degree in film and I'm finishing a degree in or for business as well now I look for work I'm trying to do some sort of entrepreneurial effort now as I finish my business degree it'd probably be to own my own company that's kind of why I want some sort of entrepreneurial effort to push push for with some sort of interesting product or service that I'd be working in I would say middle of the road a little bit shy and at times can be takes a while to warm up are you cautious to meet someone new and then from there I kind of see where to go from there I guess my family they still live in Colorado their interesting people and good as well as I talk to him pray couple times a week they're good people I have one brother and he has a couple of kids and that he's married as well that's a good question lately I've been trying to get a daily amount of exercise like jogging or riding a bike and recently got a bike something like that on a daily effort for the most part pretty good I try to if I have an outburst or if I'm being irritable I try to stay away from people who didn't like to go off on people they didn't do anything wrong Edward change the topic in my mind I guess what gets me in trouble would be more I avoid things and it kind of builds up and becomes worse and that kind of gets the trouble and basically just in a relationship with a girlfriend to be honest with that it remember exactly what it was about it's just probably in one of us is being irritable and me and going from there or it's probably a lot to do with the money as well I don't have the best financial security at this point that's a good question oh my I guess I I do Harbor a little bit of guilt from the military as far as getting out and people are still in I suppose I know that's it's not for me anymore only thing well I I used to work at for a friend and I invested into his company and the economy went down was a construction accessory company basically and kind of movement down and we lost most of our money like most of the folks around America and that pretty much it was a good and bad thing is you got to look at it from a good good perspective but it definitely put it myself into talespin I financially and couldn't really do anything about it almost was homeless for a little while but I I wish I wouldn't have invested into the company and just move forward and perhaps going to school like I'm going anyway I have I was 21 I wanted a change in life I wanted some more real-world experiences answer my country and also the added benefits of going to school or nice I didn't have much Financial capabilities at that time and I wanted to change to get out of my current situation and that was the best way out I thought are you happy yeah yeah I'm very happy I join the military I appreciate it now more that I mount and understanding kind of what I supposed war was about it is definitely changing people and myself as well yeah I did a tour both in Iraq and Afghanistan as well see I thought at first it was very easy and then I came to understand he was very difficult just because I was adjusting from military life and still having that in my head and not until now I realize that I probably just a few months ago to Reno reintegrate myself a little bit better and choose civilian life which it's it's actually it's actually pretty difficult no problem movie think I when I got out of the military versus I'd I invested like I said into my friend's company and we started that little business we're doing well for the while working and then lost all of our money and then I traveled for a while at a gender stand now is obviously some other issues but I traveled all over America good working and went to school in New York for a little while lived in a few different states and came back to California where I'm finishing school finally living the dream that's a good question I would say well it didn't and instills you with with very good I think since of sense of character and strength and you know I think there's a lot of good qualities that the military are military puts a new people but at the same time it puts a lot of bad qualities as well because you need some sort of edge or something that you need on on am almost daily basis and if you don't get that then in a lot of guys do you know turn into drinking or drugs just cuz you can't get that same Edge and that really that can really either hurt or benefit you I've been feeling okay I've had a bit of a sinus issues lately but I've been feeling okay actually I have my my thoughts I used to really have scattered thoughts and I would say I'm starting to get a little bit better Clarity which is good taking a lot of different therapy and stuff like that and it it's actually helped it's it's very as I can't really let the tough part for me is the schedule because that's if I'm not tired you don't sleep you just lay there it's Hit or Miss really some nights I can sleep pretty well some nights I have to wait till I'm exhausted and I don't like doing pills pills are bad I didn't understand that but it's basically just can't sleep because either you're on my mind is always thinking about something or something I feel that I have to do but yet I'm not doing anything that's not true trying to always do something or do you have some some troubling dreams at times but that doesn't really negate me from sleeping and wakes me up is what it does because it can't be that the dream that you remember versus the one that you don't when I don't sleep well perhaps your ability and anxiety definitely go up I I definitely get I have a tendency to get a lot of headaches and not sleeping very well definitely puts that into the mix I have not that I know of no I I don't know I try to feel happiness on a daily basis I guess what you could answer but I'm not certain I'll say my my dad's been a very positive influence that's a good question charismatic her funguy pretty tough a good worker I'd say I really enjoyed jogging the other day on the beach something that I am most proud of I would say I'm actually an online Minister as well and I married my brother and his wife and that was a pretty proud experience all good she said goodbye okay with very gradually

make sure she doesn't okay okay okay alrighty yes I'm doing well I'm a born and raised in Los Angeles California I love the weather the diversity of the people that are here and just a sense of Entrepreneurship that you can accomplish anything if you're from LA the smog and pollution it definitely it is extremely congested and maybe too much of the Hollywood persona not as much as I'd like to but I have traveled a bit sing something new I would like to see everything that my eyes can explore so experiencing new cultures and new environments okay the last trip that I can think of that I went on was to North Carolina which is somewhere that I lived before I went back to visit for a weekend and it was kind of like a party welcome home back time and then I came back to LA having my children I was I would probably be the most memorable experiences I've had I had both of my children natural childbirth without any medication so quite memorable in high school I was in a music Magnum I was a dancer and I sang a bit but primarily dance and in college my major is business with entrepreneurial I don't know I've stopped in college right now but I want to pursue business what do you do now primarily stay at home with my newborn baby while she's not a newborn she's 9 months now and I just work part-time mostly from home my dream job would definitely incorporate helping people on some type of platform may be working for a non-profit but where I could really juggle and balance being at home taking care of my family and incorporating that with providing a service that provides income I consider myself pretty outgoing I make direct eye contact I'm not afraid to engage in conversation with people I enjoy meeting new people and conversation so I think that just really being willing to actually go out and talk and Explorer makes me all going I have my mother I was raised with and my sister will 10 years younger than me those remind me dear family and my own family as I have a 12 year old son a 9 month old daughter and my boyfriend is my current family that I live with and I'm very close to my family I do like to read sometimes it definitely listen to music same thing just try to get my mind away I enjoy all types of music or sometimes I play games on my computer or just playing with my kids needs Improvement for sure I think that I displayed too much email emotion be a good or bad so I was have a little bit of a temper the last time I argue with someone was over the weekend and it was with my boyfriend and it was really about contemplating breaking up and moving away from each other in most arguments when I reflect back the main thing that I wish I would handle differently is not losing my cool controlling my temper I wish that even In the Heat of the Moment that this is the temperament and type of communication that I use I guess making what I feel like our bad decisions not being able to provide enough for my children or not feeling like I am where I'm capable of being a should be at this point in life I feel guilty about not making the right financial and career choices at this point in life so far I also feel the hardest decision I ever had to make was whether to go to a memorial for my aunt or to work that I guess in retrospect wasn't including but really it was a decision for me on business or family and I chose family and it's made me really really be more aware of my family and not let a corporation or a job control me I would say an event or space or something I could have raised for my memory would be a 911 the whole experience of 9/11 and I wish I could erase it for the entire country yes I was 19 years old when I'm in the military I got being born and raised in Los Angeles I kind of feel that a very free spirit and I'd say maybe hippie personality and when I graduated from high school I just felt that I wasn't reaching my potential and thought I could help myself by trying to establish some discipline I thought that was something that the military put off for me and it did I am happy that I did that that I served my country and that I actually enlisted yes kind of I was in Saudi Arabia when 9/11 happen and ended up serving as support for the air portion of the war was being it's his was being it happened it was happening from Saudi Arabia not very easy I think that was a very very hard time or scary time to be away from my family my son was only 12 months when I left 13 months when I left at the time it was very hard to adjust to get back to establishing trust with him again and just from being gone for 4 months it was difficult to readjust with such a big thing that had affected our entire country and in the entire world after the military I started working for the restaurant industry I became a restaurant manager and eventually a training manager and ran I'm training for a restaurant for for the house and back of house employees all aspects of the restaurant I think it made me a lot more aggressive I don't know if that's the best word to use may be confident I'm very aware of eye contact paying attention to detail and timeliness things of that nature I'd say the positive factors of the military are being very disciplined and again paying attention to detail lately I've been pretty hard on myself I haven't been working much just taking care of the baby and I'm really really trying to figure out which direction I went next in life howling forward I don't feel like I have been as positive as I used to be I feel like I need a lot more encouragement I feel like I'm a lot more needy and clingy Than I Used to Be however at the same time I've been isolating myself a whole lot more than I usually do it depends on what's happening with my daughter if my baby is awake I'm awake when she sleeps I sleep tired of probably a little cranky as well you know I've been talking to a therapist for about the past 3 months I have not had a full psychological evaluation but she definitely said I was just playing fine of PTSD depression and anxiety yes same therapist again says that she feels that I'm experiencing signs and showing signs of depression definitely what I had my baby 9 months ago really happy lately I can't think of an exact time or experience my grandmother has been a very positive influence in my life my mother have expended a lot of strong women I look up to have been very powerful influences on my life my best friend would probably describe me as a free spirit very loving loyal and a I don't know maybe I'm predictable well on the 4th of July I took my baby out to the park and just played with bubbles I know that's a little but that really makes me happy spend time with my kids and just being in the moment and being still and feel like I have no needs to be met just enjoying my time with my children I am most proud of Taking Chances even though I think I'm hard on myself sometimes I think I've been very courageous I joined the military young

Enjoy the time of Europe I really liked it could you repeat that again why didn't further my education in college but I did finish high school and some of the subject that I liked and I was in high school was I love American history and I enjoyed science stairs with some to a my top subjects when I was in high school what do you do now and now I work in real estate I work for a guy in real estate and I find property's or properties that has been abandoned by their owners or whoever that live there and if we can find the people we we we offered them a contract on the property then once they agree to that everybody signs off on it and then we start to go in and rehabitat the place fix it up clean it up and turn around and sell it at all and I put up Advertising Signs for the business also so I'm evolve a little bit into real estate I don't know if I have a dream job but my success would lie on being financially secure which I find real estate can bring that once I start to achieve it so I guess my dream job would be to how my own slower properties throughout California and possibly throughout some other states in our country and just doing very well in real estate outgoing because I'm I'm more open to people of different cultures I love to talk I love to engage in intellectual conversations I like to debate I'm not sure I'm very open to any Topic in the subject that anyone want to speak about or speak on so I consider myself very outgoing my relationship with my family is very good my dad is deceased I've about maybe 11 12 years now my mother is still alive she's live back in Georgia. Believe she's 75 years old now for social switch still resides in Georgia or brother that lives in outside Detroit so that makes up my family I contact them on a weekly basis via email or text or phone call or very close very close Southern family and I love them very much just don't get to see them as much as I like to I'm what I do to relax is to connect with on some close friends also I found out if I going to work out or do my thing is sort of really stressed I like to work out so a lot of times I go and take the dog for a walk or I'll watch a nice comedy on television so that's sort of how I get to relieve the stress in my life I'm very easy I'm I'm very hard to get upset so it's nothing to control their but when I do feel like there is a temple coming on I sort of think about something else to do or just Don allowed to control me always think of something positive to do when I feel like my temper is starting to escalate when was the the last time I argue with someone was some just last night my girlfriend where it was an argument but she felt like I wasn't giving her enough attention and I felt like I was giving her a lot of attention so neither one of us was willing to give an inch that's that's a trademark of aquarius so we sort of Argyll way to sleep not a big argument but we just couldn't agree on what we wanted to get across to one another I was basically about not enough time spent together trying to think of a situation that I handled differently sometimes feel guilty about is a divorced that I did I went through about 7 years ago I should have thought it out a lot more than I did before I made the decision I did so I guess if that's the case I guess that would be something that I wish I could have done different the hardest has not ever had to make was agreeing to go into the military and I thought about it I didn't want to do it so it was a really hard decision because I knew once I had agreed to do it to sign my name then I was obligated to go so that was a very hard decision yes I was 20 I believe I was 21 between 21 22 years old I felt like actually going back to that first question I was about 19 years old when I joined the military I felt good about it it was something I thought about doing and I wanted to do it I felt like it was becoming of a man back then to join the military and I thought good about it and as I look at it today really kind of set me up to the point that I'm in my life now with the discipline and the structure of your life and your your family life so it really kind of molded me into the person that I am at that I am now are you having a good day am I happy yes I went to the Gulf I went to the Gulf War in 1985 I spent six six months in a cup of Romaine in 1985 and that was a really really tough experience right there for me very hot very dangerous are in a hostile environment I was really easy because after 4 years of serving in military I was I was done I was I was over it I was right to get back into civilian world and see what the civilian world had to offer me and so far as been good but I'm glad at the same time I'm glad I had that military experience you know that that military back and I have in my back pocket but I was ready for civilian life in it's been great author military I worked for about 14 years as a security officer real nice job good pay unfortunate in 2005 my department was cut out due to the company not willing to negotiate our contract again so after 14 years of that I was let go IAP made me more more rounded person it made me see things a little different and civilian life it makes you a little bit stronger and make sure a little bit more discipline than the regular and a gift your foundation how to go about your business in civilian life is sort of commit to me this major better person all the way around how to accept things I have to accept different peoples in different cultures and it just makes you open up with your your thinking process have you noticed any changes I've been feeling and I'm pretty good lately not as good as I want to feel but I've been I've been I've been feeling okay how easy is it for you to go lately has been little bit hard because for some reason my neck have been tightening up on me so it's been a little bit difficult to get a good night sleep. Over the last couple weeks or so that's been a lot going on a little bit edgy little bit not attentive a little bit uneasy those are some of the things that you know normally happens to me when I don't sleep well no I haven't I know I haven't I guess I felt really happy when I was able to move away from my mother-in-law's house and move into my own house which is about 4 years ago and I made me really happy because me and my four kids and Kearney at that time my wife was all staying with my mother-in-law and which we stay there for five years so I thought when we got our house I was so happy because I could do what I want to do I could move around as I wanted to in until make me happy made my family happy also I would say my mother course and my brother and my mother course because she's the one that brought me and my brothers because I sort of see how he goes about his business and I sort of sort of meaning so I don't want to go down that same road as he's gone down and so those are my two role models that she will call it genuine upbeat friendly positive all the something I did recent that I really enjoyed nice having my three kids thank you goodbye with very gradually rising, trembling, very high, loud pitched voice",0

anymore I used to but no not not lately in the last few years now working on a movie set and getting to meet one of my favorite actors and also when I was in the military having being able to travel in Europe in a lot of places I thought I'd never be able to see my major was business administration minor was history I Need You Now actually right now I work part-time I don't have to actually have a steady job but you know I do some work with family members on Home Improvements but the primarily I'm I'm disabled so I don't get a chance to go to work very often at regular job what's your dream job oh probably work in some type of entertainment film music that's probably been my dream for years and years and I've kind of dabbled in a little bit but never really made foothold in that industry I say outgoing I just love people always have been a people person like to talk to people probably don't talk to people as much as I used to since it ain't got this missing tooth in my in my smile so it kind of takes away from me being as outgoing as I used to be relationship with your family it's pretty good I have three children have to Mom baby moms meaning you know I have two mothers of my kids but primarily my mom and I are pretty close but I have a very large family but we really don't interact that much when I'm feeling then I turn on the fish tank screensaver play videogames right read I wish I could get enough get-up-and-go to write a screenplay I've always been wanting to write and you never know what may happen with that but you know if I ever get some get up and go I'll write something but that's primarily what I do pretty good I haven't done anything crazy or nothing in my life I guess but I do have a tendency to have a little bad temper when was the law this was recently argue with a friend over something very silly it was a sports question of something about sports and you know over the years my family are some people in my family have told me there's three things you really don't discuss with people that's politics Sports and religion so I try to stay away from those subjects that's a great question I worked for a restaurant downtown who was which was owned by a very affluent lawyer in Los Angeles the only reason I'm mentioning his name because he's very prominent lawyer and not only in California but this what's this country and I lost a job they're getting into an argument with the manager of the restaurant but in actuality the owners is partner we're very very kind and they really liked me a lot and I should have never let that situation get to that something you feel guilty about I think probably not spending more time with my children or actually spending time with my oldest daughter who lives in Maryland I feel guilty for not having been more of a success in my life not having as much drive and determination as I should have that's probably my biggest no regret or what I feel is guilty about tell me about probably the hardest decision I've ever had to make was to join the military I had heard a lot of bad things about it at her good things about it but at that particular time of my life I had a you know a fork in the road and I had to choose where they go left to right and I chose to go left and joined the army and turned out it wasn't that bad of a decision tell me about midnight or something that haven't been a rat being arrested years and years ago that's 20 years to be exact and it hasn't really affected me employment wise or anything like that but it's but it's it was on my record and it was something that should have been avoided but it happened and I just wish I could take that one back yes 20 or 21 years old well three reasons one I needed a change in my life to I had some personal things going on I felt it was time to like you know just taking advantage of her and try something different and I just wasn't really happy in my college experience so I thought I'd try it are you happy yes no but I can't close I worked I was in the military when the Russians were still prevalent in Eastern Europe and we did some board of Duty between the East and West Germany and there are few incidences On the Border that could have gotten out of hand but never did fairly easy since since leaving the military in 1990 I found myself not being able to kind of interact with people as much as I used to you know things being that I was in the military you think that was a would be a little easier having live with people so close to you all the time but it actually made me a little bit more anxious and have little more anxiety around people I came back to Los Angeles and decided to move to Georgia and spent four years in Georgia working and going to school a little bit and then came back to Los Angeles four years later after 1990 on the positive side I was physically fit when I got out very physically fit and enjoy being that way for several years until you know of some things happened in my life to where I kind of let myself go but it changed me and made me more orderly place things in perspective emotionally pretty good physically tired I didn't notice any change. If anything I would say just started wanting to have more and do more in my life that's about it fairly easy I usually go to sleep and sleep well some nights I toss and turn but it's rare and I would say it's rare but you know once I get to sleep I sleep fairly well hello are visible in the mornings but since I live alone and a lot of people don't really feel that so but that ain't none of my kids are around it's it's always more enjoyable to wake up cuz you know I can see their faces and and enjoy their company yes no I haven't actually been diagnosed with depression but I have bats of that every now and then fairly recently I have my kids over for the weekend and I we had a good time enjoying each other's company so I was pretty happy man I would probably say Pastor from my church her name is Pastor Beverly Allan she's been kind of a mentor for me for several years and she's a bit of a really big influence in my life and always kind of been there for me tell your best friend hopefully well they would say I was funny you know reliable steady and you know primarily upbeat person I like to bowl so when we go bowling play begin a bunch of guys will go out we'll go bowling just have a good evening and you know enjoying each other's company and trying to kick each other's butt on the Bowling my children they're my pride and joy then extension of me once I pass away the bill live on I live on through them so it's just an honor to know your have three healthy children that are happy very intelligent and maybe make a good Market Society thank you goodbye with very gradually rising, very trembling, high, small pitched voice",0

But I was thinking as I was always I had one foot in the down the down Zone but my other foot was in like how do I get myself out of this predicament I never liked gave up hope flashes like fossil flash like every everyone long once in awhile recite what's the point you know like and then just died at the end anyways so why so why fight you know why struggle but in general live 99.999% of the time got it got it just going to go deep inside and find out what the right thing to do is and then do it the best I can well I was I mean I was pretty happy last night when I saw my girlfriend and I got to like spend quality time with her and just kind of like give her love and like not make it all about swing physical and I was pretty happy when I first got into La so we could go and I made it to Venice and I was playing hoops and sunny as beautiful and I was free at my car hey No Agenda at Money in the Bank probably I know by when I went on that trip to well person Moments 2 years ago me and my brother and my sister went on a trip together Dominican Republic that was awesome definitely definitely of the girl that was my my first love like she was a great person to really really good heart and I kind of my best friend probably thinks that like you know I'm Miss like funny cool guy that's like going to be a movie star someday or something they take everyone on like trips in like just like make everything fun for everyone else playing basketball in Venice Beach smite to my it's either my phone or I may just be the first to tie for first place to pay to play basketball in the hole that I ever played and now is play yesterday against a bunch of guys and it was just great it was just magical it's I love I love to be I love the people I love the the craziness that comes through their people on bikes with boom boxes be inclined to the people freaking just stuff in the background on the boardwalk you know running around make things interesting and I'm playing basketball I missed all of that and just that's great with very gradually rising, steady, very high, loud pitched voice",0

thank you okay yes I'm doing fine thank you California San Pedro California find the weather of course I really love the weather also this is where all my family lives so you know it's good to be around your family and just a lot to do out here I wouldn't say a lot like maybe once or twice per year memorable in a good way I would say having my children at three children so I guess that's the most memorable right now I'm just doing liberal arts so General Studies nothing specific I do take a lot of I do take a lot of science classes because eventually I do want to pursue education in Psychology but that's later on my dream job I really thought about it I don't know honestly I really don't know I wouldn't say shy I'm a little reserved I think there's a little difference oh no not really shy to text me a little bit longer to warm up I don't know I just like to read people before I really open up to them to see how much I'm willing to share and how much I'm not willing to share it's okay I mean I love my family we have our ups and downs specifically I guess with my mother you know is a little bit more up but I'm the only girl so it's expected I have three brothers so with that being said it is what it is it's good when it's good and when it's not good it could be better probably watch TV or you know does not got my pick up a book or something magazine see what's going on in fashion just something to keep my mind off things pretty good I also play games I like to play games on my phone on the computer things like that I wouldn't say I have a temper you know just average you know when things upset me I deal with them but I don't overdo it I don't you know explode or anything like that probably what's today Friday probably my see was it yesterday no day before yesterday actually was with my mom it's it's so funny the argument with about she feels that because I'm a mother a wife and a mother that I should not have a social life meaning I should be at home knitting or something I don't know so it was small that wasn't a big argument just you know I mentioned that I may go to a comedy event and she was against it I said well it's really not your decision I'm an adult so that was about it that's about it recently probably I mean thick I'll probably should have you know oh I know when my husband and I were discussing relocating from California I basically put my foot down and said I wasn't you know willing to do that and I probably should have kept it up in mind because there are some pros to moving or relocating but I guess at the time I really just didn't want to hear it so I just put my foot down and said you know we're not going anywhere with staying here I probably should have been more understanding because he is from you know he's not from California so he's probably feeling a little homesick and I should have took that into consideration guilty probably not spending as much time with my kids it's not because I don't want to spend time with them many not altogether like usually when I spend time with my children it's separate when I always together unfortunately because my middle son has autism so he takes a little bit more time so I wish that you know we could all be together and I do feel guilty about that but it's difficult so I try to give them their own individual time but it hardest decision probably I don't know my former occupation my former job relocated for about an hour and a half away something like that little bit over an hour depending upon traffic and was a good paying job great benefits great people but I had to basically play myself off from that job which did create a financial hardship in my family but I didn't have a choice because of our you know situation with our son and having only one vehicle for transportation if it's a lot of other factors you know I basically had to stop working and that was a big decision but you know I always say happiness over finances you know you can all I can always you know find another job but you know having my family together and being happy that's a different story that's about it oh that's easy probably when I had my face injured when I was in the military yeah I wish I could erase that I mean something that I see everyday when I look in the mirror I don't dwell on it it's just there but it is a mark on my face that I didn't deserve he knows a traumatic experience but it's been about I'm a 15 years or so it's been quite a while but if I could erase it yeah that would be yet yes I was in the Navy for 4 years 19 didn't have any other options it really wasn't planning on joining the military but I didn't want to go back to school at the time I just figured you're going to the military with give me the background that I needed and money for school so that's about that shows yeah I mean can change it I mean I'm not unhappy I'm at a lot of nice people you know so that was good but there was some issues that I had the military that I had not went you know probably would you know when a lot differently but you know you can't change the past no glad I did it I'm not really for that uptight person yeah it's unfortunate you know but now I did it the transition where was it was a little difficult at first you know having to adjust having a fine at the all career and you just not having that how do you say I guess I felt like comfort in the military because I knew that I was always going to have that pay check it out when I was supposed to do I always have a roof over my head you know things like that you know the civilian life basically it's your meds you don't know like you lose your job Monday or you know whatever so that's alright transition I got used to it pretty quickly thank you I went to school I started working with a Communications company I did some medical care as well got married and have children maybe a little bit more responsible I know that for a fact you know if people my age at the time you know didn't have a lot of responsibility most of my still living at home you know at early age I was out on my own no pay my own bills things like that so it did get a little bit more responsibility I'm feeling okay I already have any complaints I mean I feel fine I don't have any complaints about my life you know it is what it is to take it one day at a time that's about it yeah probably nothing really to speak about cheetah and thought yeah nothing dramatic whenever you go to sleep I usually go right to sleep well. As soon as my head hits the pillow but you know I don't I don't talk to her or anything like that very cranky very cranky Laura boy I guess no not at all no not at all I feel like I'm always happy I don't know if people tell me that all the time and say I'm always smiling and things like that so probably just morning when I woke up thank you my mother as much as we argue you know she's such a strong person and you know she's really been there for me and my kids and I just love when she isn't the person you know how she's always doing things for people to see you know just a good person she means well but she's very opinionated probably Billy Anna how is he is driving he probably say I'm typing to look gullible I don't think that's what she would probably say I don't know could be I want our family vacation we actually drove which was different we usually fly so it was a new experience you know going on the road with the kitties thank you wow that's a tough question oh I didn't really oh you're welcome bye I press the button that last question I didn't really answer it but she said thanks got it so I left it at that I don't know what thank you for should I get an answer okay sorry oldest recorded is Ian sorry they're going to think I'm bored with very gradually rising, trembling, very low, loud pitched voice",0

ask you a series of questions and then at the end she'll say goodbye and then you'll press this button yes I'm doing quite well I am from West Covina California the sports teams I like the Lakers the Dodgers and the USC football and and the weather the traffic don't like the traffic at all and other than that it's probably probably probably yet no not right now I am in a job that they're just commute back and forth about 12 miles so that's about as the extent of my traveling what do I enjoy about traveling probably seeing new places when I due to trouble seeing new places and people from different states different countries and picking up on their cultures one of my trips let's see I have a friend in Atlanta Georgia and he works for the TV that work down there and when the Dodgers were playing in Atlanta I took a trip to go see him and we went to go see the games as well Atlanta is a good nice Sports Town hot and muggy but we could deal with it as much like here the expressways are about the same traffic they have their own traffic problems but it was really good experience I got to see and meet people from Atlanta Georgia and it was really nice time one of my most memorable experiences is being in the Marine Corps and liberating Kuwait that was probably the one of the the best experiences of my of my life we had a little resistance and trouble from Saudi Arabia into Kuwait and liberate Kuwait City and there was it was great what I studied at school basically was broadcasting and the radio and cuz I was a radio operator in the Marine Corps so I could study broadcasting I am but I also love history what do you do now what do I do now I am a part-time broadcaster for and it is and basically operator engineer and run all the programming from satellite sources and a lot of programs what is my dream job good question probably similar to what I have in the Marine Corps I was a Sergeant Marine Corps had my own Squad so if I could have being in a management position where I have my own crew and take care of my own crew and look after their needs that would probably be my dream position it depends on the kind of mood I'm in sometimes I am I feel shy and just want to stay home other times I'm a little outgoing I want to go out with my friends and and go to dinner and have drinks and watch a sporting event why cuz I'm feeling good and I want to feel company of my friends and just want to talk and Converse how good relationship with my family my mother is like one of my best friends I have confide in her with basically all of my problems and good things my dad is is very good man we get along very well and I have three sisters that the two of them I see on a regular basis and one of them I really don't but we're all we're close family I know it's what do I do to relax is a my apartment complex I have a Jacuzzi so I spend 20 minutes in the jacuzzi and go for a swim afterwards or I will go on a bike ride I have my own mountain bike and I like to travel 5 miles then get to work out it so when I'm feeling since I go get a workout concussion I'm sometimes it's it's very hard but I have to look at myself in and limit myself on what the possible consequences of an uproar of my upper could could lead to so whether to be with my family or my co-workers I have to always look at my soft before I get very angry and and temperament that temperamental no I don't think so no a good question last time I got into argument was probably with my Dad we I go visit my parents and they have a pool and a pond trying to clean the pool we had a disagreement so we had an argument a situation where I wish I was at sea I was downsize from a full-time position back in December of 2012 and I think I could have probably avoided it if I read the signs probably work a little harder and and probably I don't know I'm done a better job at that position something I feel guilty about ask a question I don't think I feel really guilty everything I have done I have lived up to you and not felt guilty about having wrong to anybody in particular and that not that I feel guilty I don't feel guilty about everything hardest decision I've ever had to make sure she probably when I was 17 years old sign a contract to join the Marine Corps and it was a six-year contract and I know that was probably a lot for my family but it's something I wanted to do but it was a really hard one and I made it and I live through it the six years and I think I am better for something I could have erased from my memory at sea let's see I'm trying to think probably I've got into to bar fights so probably limiting the alcohol use some of those some of those times and avoided trouble in the bars yes I have I was 18 I wanted the toughest challenge for an 18 year old and I thought the and I knew that the Marine Corps would give it to me so I took it are you happy absolutely yes yes now I was in Desert Storm pretty easy to get used to growing my hair out again cuz I had it really short for 6 years and I really didn't like getting haircuts every week other than that I went too soon as I got out I went to broadcasting school and everything pretty much went back to normal I went to broadcasting school and then I I got a radio job in Palm Desert California and that was my first grader job but I don't know I work there for three months and I forgot a job in Riverside so after that I kept getting jobs and till now I've worked in radio for 22 years it changed me because I am more disciplined self this fund pay attention to detail more attention to detail than I ever have kind of a mental thing paying attention to detail but they drilled it into our heads pretty plainly I like to keep everything in its place and I like to keep ficked nobody taught me in general been feeling really well I've been exercising four times a week either swimming or bike riding and or both so I've been I've been feeling really well I can't complain I know I've always stated pretty even Keel and I like to like to keep it that way I don't like to get too low or get too high I like to stay stay even-keeled it is pretty pretty easy when I work out a lot but there are sometimes when I I do if I'm not a 5-mile bike ride and then I I I swim like 10 laps in the pool those days are easy for me to get a good night's sleep and some of the other days where I just do a bike ride or a swim but not both of those are pretty easy to sew sometimes I have too much energy but the but when I work out that energy yet I seem to have a good night sleep what am I like when I don't sleep well well I get up and I am really groggy and tired and I have to have at least three cups of coffee and that usually gives me the energy that I need for the whole day no I have never have I recently had a checkup from the from the VA and everything was was perfect so I'd I do not have PTSD again I am at my last physical I was asked if I was feeling depressed and I told him no and they did tests and determined that I wasn't wasn't a depressed person so I never feel depressed I always feel you killed it and never feel depressed the last time I felt really happy and well I'm a big sports fan so whenever sports teams do well especially the Dodgers which they have been doing really well lately keeps me happy and I like to see my favorite teams do well because I feel on the part of the team because I attend the games and support the team and I like to do like to see them succeed so basically it's baseball season right now but football season is around the Home Run basketball teams in the hockey season so epic sports fans to one of my teams do album I am I am feeling really really good somebody that's been a positive influence in my life I would say my parents they've been married since 1955 so I'm going up on almost 70 years 60 years 60 years so I think my parents my mom is a big influence and she's a very good woman and taught us to be very good people so I would say my parents my best friend describe me as determined driven and willing to succeed I would think something I did recently in which I really enjoyed let's see hide recently went toys for game with my boss and it was a couple weeks ago and we had really good seats from from the team and we had a great night. The food we had hot dogs and and french fries and the and the Dodgers won in the bottom of the night so it was a really really good game and it was a good experience most proud of being a marine serve six years in the Marine Corps around the Desert Storm veteran so Tuesday to the rank of Sergeant at the at 22 years old so I am grateful and most proud to be a United States Marine thank you we buy with very gradually rising, trembling, very high, small pitched voice",0

good I'm originally from Orange County California and now I live in Los Angeles I went to college here so I enjoy the fact that a lot of my friends are still around so just ability to see them and be able to hang out with them is really good obviously the weather has been amazing all the time so those are a few things I like about la right obviously traffic and I don't know I think traffic is the main reason and aside from that I don't have much to complain all my used to for my old job but not anymore so I'm pretty much based in La most of the time I'm just a bility to see other things and explore new things whether it be going to a new site seeing area or trying different kinds of food just the fact that I'm in Conjuring something else or something you is something I enjoy about traveling and obviously the people that I am with when I am going traveling cuz I rarely travel by myself so you know whether I travel with my boyfriend or friends the fact that I have companions that I enjoy spending time with you something I enjoy sure I for the 4th of July past weekend or two weekends ago actually went to San Francisco to visit my boyfriend so we actually he was moving from LA to San Francisco so we drove up to the Bay Area saw his family and then stayed with my friend who recently moved into a new apartment in Oakland so we hung out with her spend the day in the city went to the ferry building went to the Fisherman's Wharf and hung out and went shopping so although you was kind of a Bittersweet goodbye cuz we are now I'm now in LA and he's in San Francisco but it was a really fun trip from the past trip or just in general I studied mathematics and economics I am actually I just quit my job last Friday I'm taking some time off before I go back to graduate school my dream job let me think for a second I think I'm really interested in social commerce and Retail so something that combines my interests and also gives me the ability to spend time with people I love my previous job I was working a lot so I was always constantly working and I didn't really get to see anyone or do anything on my own or as I have a hobby but I don't have a job that would give me the flexibility to pursue what I want to do outside of my professional life outgoing I don't know what I mean you people or when I just hang out with people in general I'm not I'm not shy to speak about my feelings or you ask questions or engage in a conversation initiate a conversation so I don't consider myself shy sure my family and I are pretty close there back in Orange County but I've been living apart from them for about a ready for years but I still visit them almost every other weekend we go out to dinner and then I hang up my mom we have our shopping strips and spa days once in awhile so we get to bond so I think I have a pretty close relationship my family most importantly my mom she's like almost like my best friend I work in the entertainment industry when I work at a YouTube Production Studio which we make content for YouTube vloggers or whatever you call it so I just kind of go on YouTube and look at my favorite YouTube Vlogs from people it's kind of like a mini reality show so I think it's pretty fun other than that I just kind of go through my old pictures to think about like fun times I've had bruised Apple from my trip to Costa Rica last year at my boyfriend or my trip San Francisco with my friends or just kind of think about like good times I've had in the past or also I enjoy like exercising of being in nature so I would go for a hike in Santa Monica or something like that I think I'm pretty good I've never had a situation when I was out of control or now is I was acting like I was in myself I think when I don't know I don't think I've actually never had a situation when I was I wasn't able to control my temper I just kind of stay calm and think about the situation and think about how I'm going to respond to it and try to respond to it wisely let me think I I don't I can't really remember the last time I argue just saw on maybe when I argued in my old remain about our friendship kind of so we had a conversation about how both of us are kind of drifting apart from each other but it was more of a conversation than the argument so we were able to run both of us are kind of like getting heated up by the topic but we was just kind of cool down and talk about the situation and talk things through oh yeah sure so I remember a few months ago a friend of mine visited from Washington DC and we enter a different friends house in Hollywood so when I was there there was this guy who kind of was very confrontational with me about what I do or what I want to do or my stands on certain topics for example was education and then and he started kind of saying like oh you know you're not secure about the Way You Are by blah blah so I kind of was I kind of got angry at them and I just told him like you're not giving me a good first impression and you're what you're saying doesn't make sense and I kind of like was very argumentative with them I wish that I was more common was able to kind of pro more on why he thought that way instead of attacking him verbally guilty I'm guilty about quitting my job too early I'm going back to graduate school and the fall so I was actually supposed to stay a little later till end of July but hey I wanted to enjoy my time and just be unemployed for a little bit so I ended up quitting my job a little early which is a burden on my boss so that's something I feel guilty about tell me about the hardest decision sure I can talk about my recent graduate school preparation process I was deciding between Glee which is in the Bay Area and he witches in Boston like I mentioned before my boyfriend lives in the Bay Area and then he probably would have a I can be together with him in the same area but I think once I got the acceptance letter I knew that I wanted to go there just right away so I had to decide between being on my boyfriend and being complacent and kind of comfortable in California vs venturing out into different city different state different people different environment and B&B in Massachusetts and I ended up deciding with although it's far away from my parents family friends boyfriend but I wanted to explore something else and being a different environment I don't know if I have anything I want to completely erase from my memory may be my great grandma passed away when I was in the eighth grade I remember I was in a different room but my grandma passed away in a different room but had I stayed there with her I could have kind of see her passed away but I didn't get to do that cuz I was watching TV and some other room and just hanging out I wish I could erase it from my memory cuz it was kind of a traumatic event in my life no I haven't I've never served in the military I did not I have never served oh I wouldn't know because I didn't listen to military no I've never served in the military I didn't serve in the military I didn't serve in the military you know just I quit my job I had a good going away party I'm getting ready for grad school a lot of exciting things ahead so I'm excited and happy not really I think I've been a lot more positive than before very easy I'm grumpy and I eat a lot more and I drink a lot of coffee no no I have not 2 months ago when I got my acceptance call from my dream School I think first and foremost my mom she's always reminded me of who I am and you know why I am on this Earth and it sounds kind of philosophical but she's been my Foundation they would say energetic kind of intense sometimes outgoing yeah I enjoyed when I went hiking two days ago and I want my friend Stephanie it was a two-hour hike it was a lot of fun and I always loved hiking so that was something I really enjoyed recently nice I'm most proud of the fact that I was able to Aquaman Aquaman at myself internal environment I actually came when I was I came here when I was in when I was 13 so the fact that I got to where I am in life despite not having not learning how to speak the language about 10 years ago that is something that I'm very very proud of goodbye hello Cat takes off with very gradually rising, very trembling, very low, very small pitched voice",0

California born and raised well besides me and my home I love that there is so many various things to do I don't believe you can live here and be bored if you are active person like myself that is so overcrowded it's just too many people here people are not more hospitable I mean if you speak to someone I feel like I should speak back and I look at you like they want to do something to you or just wake up so angry I don't like a lot of our political laws or issues that we have here and the economy you travel not as much as I would like to but yes I do I enjoy the whole set up the whole agenda the planning the research and I find that very exciting for me I like exploring new places I never been a going back somewhere I really love that just the thought of how much I'm going to put a sign for shopping also don't return Wars and picture taking doing videos and is creating a new experience that I had never had before sure I recently just came back from San Francisco I've been there before but I was in one particular part of the Castro district and I explored other parts of San Francisco is one of my favorite places to go in the first place I decide to go besides putting down my luggage at a hotel would be a restaurant called Scoma's which is actually on the pier and they have the best crab cakes ever and the last time I went I saw Jerry Springer the show you no talk show host I did some shopping I actually met up with friends or some bars actually went I'm a foodie so I went to a couple of restaurants or heard about on the Food Network I took a boat ride and I've visited some friends so I really had a good time I have several of those but one of my most memorable experiences in life would be the day that Barack Obama became president that was a memorable experience for me and I wish that a lot of my family members who have passed on was here to see that that would always stay with me like a tattoo is a very memorable moment that they'll never be forgetting it'll go down in history and it is history and it's just a great experience for me and other people like myself to know that we have transition Beyond race and that will in some ways and that you know anyone can become president and really fulfill their dreams there's no limits World depends on okay I am a dispatch manager the last school I attended with and I have my degree in homeland security and investigations I work for a private security firm I'm actually over seeing about 12 to 20 people a day I worked various hours and my job is very tedious I do a lot of problem solving and it makes the night go by fast I work from 10:30 to 6:30 and within the Dispatch Center I should say a command center that I oversee we do dispatch and also surveillance so half of the night we're looking at 20 cameras for corporate and residential account also dealing with supervisors and security officers who actually are at a site and we put them in with Carter mobile vehicle or mobile van where they stay on site until the actual site is ready and develop for people to come through after construction so we make sure that we obtain and make sure these places are very well-rounded with security we do a lot of observing and report so any information anything that's happening on site for the the security officers they allow us to know about it I do everything from inventory to attendants talking to other locations out-of-state making sure are a data information in their systems are updated a computer software so anything you think about I'm actually involved in when it's far as the company is concerned so it's very tedious but very rewarding position my dream job is completely opposite from what I have now I've been writing some 36 I've been writing songs since I was about nine years old and started when I was in the junior choir at church and I've always had a passion for that I feel like that runs through my bloodstream music is is there's a song I would always say for every situation and occasion and I feel like music watch through my bloodstream is just a part of my DNA and who I am and my dream job would be an engineer who owns their own record label and a very big time songwriting / producer oh I'm definitely not shy that's not me at all I'm very expressive person as you can probably hear I've never been shy a day in my life but I'm more outgoing more blunt I would say that's just who I am I just feel like you know it's people we're all you know made up of different characteristics and personality traits and I just like expressing myself I talk a lot I get that from my father and I just you know what I what I feel I feel like I should put out there and voice my opinion like anyone else that's just who I am interesting that's a good question I listen to music but I like to go to the beach and taking the whole scenery just to smell the ocean you know water you know that that whole experience of my feet in the sand looking around just taking in the small things just you know I appreciate them Breeze I do stuff like that when I get a chance to but sometimes a glass of wine or just watching TV be having a conversation sometime praying that you know or whatever about anything that goes on with my family so it's different things I do and shopping always helps to his very therapeutic for me that's number one I would say pretty good I would say a my twenties I would have a different answer for you I was more quick-tempered I'm pretty good with that yes I do get upset and angry about things depends on what it is but I just think what when you grow and you become you know you know you get older you know not always maturity doesn't always come with age and knowledge and I feel like as I've grown as a person I'm a lot older now more calm and more centered about things so I don't get is at angry as I used to it is a better way to deal with things besides getting angry a couple of days ago and I argue with my ex girlfriend over the state of things in our past relationship that still bothers us both and we're just trying to get to the point where we can communicate better we say things when we're angry we're still heard about things we're trying to work through so that was the last argument I had there's so many of those I wish I would have handled a lot differently wow so many of those situations I wish I would have handled differently good question I'm sorry for taking so long it's just so many things I I think about wow handled differently I don't know that such a hard question but you know I can't answer that question for you I can we plan example I was I think maybe 18 years old and are 19 and my brother is a couple years younger than me my dad is physically abusive and he was never there for us he was the type of father who just kind of came around my mom will let him whoop us or he'll show up whenever he wanted to but he wasn't obsessed and your father that was active in our lives and one particular time I guess my mom and told my dad that my brother was having company without permission and he went over there and you beat him up really bad the only reason I knew was because I was working for my mom at her hair salon and he brought them up they're black and blue and and bloody and I feel like I had a nervous breakdown I didn't handle that well I feel like I I'll should have been there to protect them I hope I'm not going to cry cuz it still bothers me I feel like I should have been there to protect him and I wasn't and it bothers me and I take on a lot that bothers my wasn't there when it happened and I called social services and told them what happened and I just wish I would have took him to the hospital and I broke down and I just wish I would have been there for him and that bothers me and I just feel like I should have dealt with a better just took him to the hospital instead of going in the bathroom and crying and that bothers the hell out of me to this day just what I said about my brother I just wish I was there for him when it happened and I wasn't and I blame myself for it but I I feel guilty about not being there for my ex-girlfriend Financial at the time I couldn't get to Vegas so I couldn't be there for her when she was in hospital and sometimes you couldn't be there for me but it just I take a lot on my shoulders and I blame myself for stuff I know that I can't control but I feel guilty about that Barry about that and so many other things my grandfather Frank passed away and he was a great grandfather and I used to ask my family members when he was I don't know where he was located where he moved to new phone numbers anything and over the years I was asked what happened to him they need information and didn't tell me and then I found out years later that he passed away he was asking about me and I feel bad but I didn't know how to find him where he was so those are some of the things I feel bad for tell me about the hardest. It's a lot I give you one a plan example no I'm never served in the military at all but I can't give an example of something my mom she does hair like I said she has her own hair is what I want for Karen hair salon I remember going to the shop one day just kind of hang out with her and she introduced me to a client of hers and I remember the lady said oh I didn't realize you had a daughter I knew you had a son and this is the first time I heard that and it really got to me it hurt and I feel like there's no excuse for that and I didn't want her to explain and that just really hurt me to my callcore I talked to my dad about it I called him and he said I would just ignore it how do you ignore somebody saying that you don't even know that you exist how to ignore that and a part of me sometimes wish I could just erase a lot of things she's done like that away cuz it's still tends to bother me I have no military experience I thought about in the past I thought about it since I actually got my degree in homeland security and investigation I thought about becoming a police officer there so many things I thought about getting into but the weather like freezes on certain positions I've applied for I just went a different direction to still have to do with the type of law enforcement like what I'm doing now but never got into that I have no military experience I never signed up for the military just thought about it are you happy I'm kind of really never thought about it by happier I didn't enlist or not somewhat yeah I'm happy with the way things are I don't think the military will actually be for me it's some good things about it like paying for college tuition always having to fall back on GI bill experience of you know fighting for your country but do I think that was for me I'm kind of past that at this point I think I'm past the age limit where you can even sign up for it so no I don't have any regrets no I have no experience in that so I don't know I don't know if people that have been in the military like my family members uncles and aunties and Dino that are still here or not here anymore never been in the military so that's I can't answer that question I don't know I just heard about it but people have been through after they come by the military but I have no idea overstressed happy at moments feeling sometimes to feed it and insecure hurt I spent a lot of time alone is it by choice no but good and bad not great yeah happy a lot of times when there's moments where I'm really really sad is well too so they don't really balance each other out at all not at all I do so much tossing and turning 4 years I don't remember last time I got a good amount of sleep until recently when I bought this Brookstone pillow which is been helping but I'm still tossing and turning and then why can't I play there I want to go to sleep and it just does not happen and I don't know why if it's my stress or what's going on but my sleep patterns are not great and I still get up and do I have to do like I paid 9 hours or so so that's just me active like I am now completely Wide Awake some days I'm fatigued and tired and a little sad but usually I'm just up and just being me and active and overly bubbly and a busybody normally usually yes in the past over 10 years ago I was diagnosed with that yes couple of days ago I felt really happy well sometimes you know in life because nobody's perfect and there's things I get to get out of it get to me sometimes you put the weight of the world on my shoulders and we take care of everybody else sometimes you get lost in that transition and I just seen I'm happy to have everyday I thank God for every day I live and I'm at I'm up and I'm able to work and do things that I need to do for myself and I do you spell happy and rested and I caught up on shows and I relax and I ate and I just had a good day of a peace and Tranquility which is not it's not a regular thing for me is kind of weird to have those kind of days cuz it's so much is going on oh that's easy my grandmother she's been passed away for about 20 years now 20-plus say she's been the backbone of who I am I'm so much like her as far as hard work and determined strong-willed I mean just the glue to keep the family together she was the backbone of our family and she's one of the she's my hero she did everything she you know she was so selfless she put everything on the back burner but everybody first you get what I mean because that's what I'm doing to I know I get that from her just you know endless caring and loving I never had to question that and my grandmother even she was a rare commodity a real real person of so much goodness and I just appreciate everything she taught me he would pay for our public school I'm sorry for a private school and help my mom and my dad when they first got married years and years ago with a second car will pick us up everyday everything she could to help and was there for everybody and then some she is a great example of a but you know I'm a human being that went beyond the Call of Duty to do everything she could for her family and she's my hero and I'm really proud and honored to be a part of her bloodline and I miss her dearly how is your best friend I don't have one but if they if I did have one I would say that would say that I'm a loving person I love hard that I'm creative and funny articulate down to earth very blunt a good friend and I value friendship you know and I made a mistake sometimes you piss me off I can be a little mean and be sarcastic but overall a good person that's just too hard on yourself and doesn't get herself enough credit and gets taken advantage of sometimes because of how nice I am if I had one I was thinking it would say that oh that's an easy one shopping I went to the mall and I shopped I shopped online I had so many packages coming from high heels tennis shoes to jackets and cute very creative sexy dresses so shopping puts my mind out of everything that we talked about as far as my feelings of hurt her insecurities all that goes away cuz shopping is therapeutic and once I get an idea in my mind and coordinating colors and I just know what I'm doing this and that with I'm very creative and in I like things out of the norm so that just makes me if I could shop all the time that would be a drink nice thanks my accomplishments with school me being out on my own for a long time I've been on my own since I was 18 19 years old and I've been able to keep up my own place and I'm very responsible I pay my bills before I do anything else for me and I am very particular about paying bills and that's just always been at the Forefront to me to make sure to my house I was okay before I do anything else so I'm proud of my maturity level and my responsibilities with very gradually rising, very trembling, very low, very small pitched voice",0

It was probably the decisions had let my daughter move forward with the heart surgery that the doctor says that she need it but it was it was a very scary time and place for us but we we move forward with it was a decision that I did not make a loan I made it along with my husband an event that I wish I could erase from my memory would be as an as a child being touched any of her inappropriately by a family member no I've been feeling fine I've been feeling fine this summer the work stress is still there but my kids are out of school so our household is a lot more relaxed my son is actually in Sacramento for the past couple of weeks so it's just my husband and my daughter and I and we're sort of taking a little bit of a laid-back approach to Summer before our vacation comes up have you noticed any changes no I'm pretty easy over the last two to three weeks I think there was one night or I had so much on my mind I just find it hard to fall asleep but in general I do sleep well what workouts help with that as well I just sort of not as social a little more quiet lag ragging no I have not no today or yesterday just the ability to be blessed to wake up every day and I have an opportunity to make the best day that I can that's that's a blessing so I'm happy about that every day my mother is definitely a positive influence in my life she is someone that I go to and confidence all the time she's a very spiritual woman and always seems to lead me appointment in the right direction my best friend actually passed away so I will I will use my husband who was a really good friend actually in at this point he is my best friend and he would probably describe me as someone who lives my life passionately who is very dedicated and loyal and who wears her emotions on her sleeve on Saturday my husband my daughter and I just we were in Burbank handling some business and after that it was so hot and my daughter asked if we could go to Sherman Oaks Galleria to hang out and it was not something that was my choice but it was just really nice to be able to hang out and I really casual environment and do something that that she wanted to do and I really please her and we went shopping and we had a we had a really good time but ordinarily I would have never chose that activity but because my husband and I were able to throw whatever other plans we head out the window and just enjoy her and ended up being a nice family outing nice I'm proud of my children I have a 7 year old daughter and a nine-year-old son and I'm very proud of the way that they are are growing up and that their character and their academic skills and really that the little people that they have become thank you goodbye with very gradually rising, trembling, low, small pitched voice",0

135,636,"you just look at Aliso she's asking a series of questions and then usingyesall right I was born in Philadelphia but we lived all over that the place so I'm not from Philadelphia to just before in there and live there for a year I love the weather people are generally more friendly than where I've lived on the East Coast the scenery the environment the beach the mountains the bike paths and the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables the usual the traffic I guess some of the people in the entertainment business a bit of the materialism and you know when you meet like the stereotypical deaths I used to when I used to have a life I been to 41 countries and I really enjoyed that wish I could do it again one day I guess since I'm from nowhere it's fun to go somewhere where it doesn't you don't have to fit in your already a weirdo so it doesn't matter that you're not from the place and I just really enjoy eating meeting people from different cultures I love seeing new environments I love seeing historical things are now just things been credible Beauty I love meeting different types of people food I love different food so any foods for money foreign Land Rovers fun and any other thing I secretly like that I try not to get too wrapped up in is that if you can completely and utterly escaped and forget about your real life how to write let me think for a minute I don't know which one to pick I guess I I'm trying to think in my head I probably shouldn't be overthinking I'm trying to think do I pick a horrible one to give you guys more emotion or do I pick a normal what are my traveling companion was my you know husband too I don't know what his story is I suppose he's gay so we went to to Singapore and it was just fabulous I except for the parts having to deal with him I loved being there and you know the variety of delicious unbelievable food I'm a huge kraylix I've been so that was really fun it's a big shopping place so I kind of wished I were a bit younger cuz they had fabulous fashions I like the weather cuz it was hot and steamy it was really easy to get around things like that let's see for some reason I'm thinking of a bad one nothing I assume you mean towards travel when I was traveling through Vietnam and Cambodia I got a really bad case of hemorrhoids hemorrhagic dengue fever I was in hiding why wasn't I was in accentuate sorry in Vietnam and I was horribly sick and I was hallucinating and my traveling companion husband person I I said please go get me some water I was in a really sweating profusely and I've been very sick for a while and he went out to get the water I don't know sometime in the morning and he came back and I don't know 7 at night or something and said that he some fellow on a motorbike instead let me take you somewhere where you can get some water and I don't know what the hell you did all day long so I just think back to then and I remember coming in and out of Consciousness and thinking I'm going to die here and I wondered if I would ever be and I found in this hotel we were staying so I don't know how I survived and I'm probably over dramatizing it but it was just memorable because I often think back and when I see people sick or whatever and think she why the heck did I survive that's not my PTSD thing though if you're wondering I studied film as an undergrad while I started off and dance and then I realized I wasn't really that talented I mean I was okay but not really that good so I moved over to film and I really enjoyed that and then later on in life I went back to school and I became a lawyer I'm an underemployed lawyer I guess I I got tossed out with many people you know I Now understand why the what-do-you-call-it the the age discrimination laws kick in after 40 well you know it's extremely difficult to get rehired so now I have a couple of clients I make a couple of pennies you know would prefer to be fully employed not really going so well so I'm here today to make my 35 measly bucks does after paying off all those loans and everything for law school because I stupidly took one of the more expensive law schools in the country so many of you students listening don't do that I mean don't pick an expensive grad school if you don't get financial aid and you don't have a financial help from your family so anyway I because I was spent all my life paying off my undergrad and my graduate schools I now find myself looking down the barrel of long-term unemployment and retirement and not having any you know any insurance or any enough for a what they say we're supposed to live to in the future not anymore I don't I don't have any dreams left when I was younger and my dream job is to be an ambassador because I thought it would just be so much fun to you no have contact with different countries and to get to be friendly and meet people all the time and to represent your country in a positive way I know I don't think I have any dreams left I am too old I've I've nothing at the world once anymore well I was always extremely outgoing and friendly up until maybe I don't know 5 years ago and then I I guess I'm so friendly and outgoing I just sometimes I just give up and I don't even try anymore well it's embarrassing when people say what do you do to say you're unemployed people think I've had so many people say well why don't you just go out and get a job will what are they assume that you're being lazy or something like that where it's like okay assholes at work since I was 12 you know right I didn't have fun during college I worked three jobs to pay for it all and my lungs I don't know I guess I'd I just stopped trying because and I'm a little embarrassed about my situation you know I'm quote on quote married to somebody who has this secret life I don't know what his story is I guess I'm embarrassed about my my life being so pretty much a complete and utter failure of every every goal that I had I go for a bike ride along you lovely bike path I go swimming on occasion I will drink have a drink have a low alcohol tolerance so basically one or two will pretty much knocked me out I don't know I used to do yoga and stuff like that nowadays I try to do deep breathing it depends who the person is in a normal situation with normal people or with complete strangers I'm pretty darn good at it with two people I'm no longer any good at it at all my husband and my mother cuz they were both extremely physically and emotionally abusive and I finally learned recently on the last maybe 10 years or so that that's the stuff they had that I accepted as normal was not normal so I did all the assertiveness thing where you say this is not no please don't lie to me or whatever the thing they were doing and you know the person supposed to say oh I didn't know that was hurting you let me change but of course that never actually works in real life so now I find that if I must have contact with these people of HIV one of them have to I get extremely if they lie to me I just get fed up and you know confront them on it well what can you give me a chance I guess it was my husband since I'm paying the cell phone bill and he's on the family plan it turned out that he had 44 pages of text while he's off on the secret trip to some summer camp don't ask I don't I don't even want to think about it I don't know who these people are that he's texting with so I asked him what the f are you these text who are you doing this with and I tried calling some of the numbers and the people would just hang up on me so you know my imagination started thinking what the hell is he doing at this summer camp why did the people that he's texting and texting photos to not respond you know draw your own conclusions so you know any wasn't answering me and he kept lying and he's one sentence emails he was sending back so I you know I started getting these threats in the e-mails back like oh yeah well if you don't tell me I'm going to call up this number and find out who they were which he wouldn't answer me and then as I said I called and they're just hung up on me so who knows who these people well I mean there are the General Life ones like I wish I had never married this person I situation I wish I'd handled differently I guess I had a job I actually was a head lawyer for a company probably won't believe it now you guys were out there watching this and the the president started doing all these things that were ethically wrong and going against my advice and I should have gotten the Hades out of there I should have quit immediately but I was still paying off you know $200,000 worth of student loan so but I just should have gotten out of there gee willikers well I just see the only real thing I feel guilty about is something I prefer not to discuss on tape I mean I've had enough drinks tell me over the years that I was justified hardest decision I tried to make I don't know I mean every stupid a lot of decisions have been difficult the hardest one I've no idea the last 49 years I I guess I could erase my big pts State when I was 18 a serial killer abducted me and I escaped from that I now I haven't I don't know you know sing along I don't know neither here nor there I'm just numb anymore I don't really care I'm just waiting for you know to die well I kind of had a bad blow last week with something and I just didn't have an appetite for like I don't know 5 days and horrible thing is I didn't lose a single pound I don't know let's say I didn't have hunger so I didn't eat and didn't seem to affect my body at all well I seem to have developed some horrible neck pain and that's made things doubly difficult the second thing is that I because I'm always plagued by these horrible nightmares they're actually just actual events of actually happen to me just replaying over and over I am an internet addict and I just put stuff on YouTube or or whatever on all night long and you know I frequently have loud loud sounds so I don't sleep that well and I have a horrible horrible that at the moment and live in a very noisy place why do I live in a noisy place because I have been unemployed as I told her underemployed as I told you when I don't have money to live in a place that should be the equal of all the hard work I've done in my life you're looking at it you know like anybody would be my I don't feel that well I'm tired I I don't know just tired yes a couple people that I've met with have told me that I I had it the first time I don't know maybe 15 the recurring nightmares the I don't know I I I developed anxiety and I freaked out you know if I think I'm going to run out of gas I get short of breath and I don't know in the soup I used to be able to handle anything now something stupid happens and I catastrophize it and think that it's going to be horrific so I have to talk myself out of it hello I've lost all the ability to trust and I'm numb to all feelings partly I will let you know what you said well you I think my PTSD I was fine and I had it after the eighteen-year-old incident I just fine and dandy and then something happens in the last like decade I just had hit after hit after hit and it just brought everything back up and or maybe it's cuz I'm not that busy anymore so I'm time to ruminate over all these horrible things and I've said Elaine thing I'm way worse now than I was after the you know escaping from a serial killer I mean kind of kind of pain in the neck I'll literally I'm not being healthy I will you know drink a couple things of alcohol which I don't I don't know something's wrong with my heart they told me and so any more you know even if I have just one causes a lot of pain and stuff or I try to do stuff to relax or you know if I'm having a really really bad day I might I might it myself or hurt myself and some other way threat because after you after you do that releases all in all you're all freaked out and then if you hurt yourself you got really distracted like how come you know this really hurts and then you don't really think about the horrible thing that was in your head anymore you're thinking about I've got this I have tried to get help I can't get any help now I don't have any insurance I can't I'm not poor enough I would need to go through all of my retirement savings and be penniless to get any free help so I mean I'd like to be a normal person again and I'd like to be happy I'd like to be a functioning human you know like I used to be no I don't have the money and nobody cares about you know lower-middle-income class people you know I've been to a zillion cerum not a gazillion but you know I don't know 15 therapist maybe over my 30 years or whatever it is been sometimes you got somebody that's good and I found that the younger the person the better actually like a cup one when I was in law school I went to see someone or when my father died when I was 18 at the same time that other thing happens I I saw some students they were actually the best ones the worst ones seem to be the ones that are like in my age category or older cuz it kind of checked out and they just want somebody who's there but in terms of like I don't know how I did that young MD whatever think it was called once and I'm really work sometimes you get a new gets like wants some therapist said to me you don't want to kill yourself you just want a different life so when I am suicidal I just think of that sends I don't want to kill myself I just want a different life so is sometimes you get a nougat but you know generally it hasn't really saved me yet do I have to I just did sometimes you get us a good therapist oh one thing I learned is that most therapists are actually more screwed up than me you know I may seem screwed up to you guys here but you know at least I used to be able to function I was somewhat successful and I I've never intentionally hurt people I don't screw people over I'm not dishonest in my work compassionate and I found so many therapists you know they live their little teeny lives in Suburbia or whatever the heck they're from and they're totally incapable of relating to anything that's outside of their world I haven't been as I told you so but I did go I noticed that it was fun to go somewhere once a week and have somebody listen to your for Tales of Woe although sometimes it got frustrating the person was not helpful really happy I've been trying to cultivate it the last night I was on the bike path and I looked around at the beautiful nature things and there were briefs literally seconds where I had it and then him some aggressive bike ride or somebody else to come along and that would be destroyed but otherwise more than perhaps a brief second or a couple of seconds I don't even know I don't even know oh oh oh it is good oh my God are you even listening I don't think you're listening very carefully you like some of the strings I've had people is that what you wanted me to tell you about I I don't even know what the question was anymore to tell you the truth sorry no just the empty silence that I'm supposed to be filling to answer or you what was the question I don't know sometimes therapies helpful sometimes it's not show the happiness that was a question sometimes I've had half my happiest moment was when I climbed up inside the Great Pyramid of Giza that was extremely hot I don't know it's just wonderful wonderful feeling I'm claustrophobic so I was proud that I made it through there and it was just an amazing sight Cassius is a test to see how one reacts when there's an uncomfortable silence am I supposed to be pushing the button for the person to come in now all right she did stop talking I thought it was a test of how one reacts during an uncomfortable side with very gradually rising, trembling, very low, small pitched voice",1

more of what brings you Joy that's my current dilemma I think my dream job would be weighing 70 lbs less and being a really emotionally diverse actress so I can play comedy roles which is easier for me and too heavy drama rolls which is more of a challenge to be vulnerable and to open up emotionally kind of what I'm standing right now and I would look thousand percent better cuz my hair would be long I really am thinking I don't have a family anymore my father passed away and there's no relationship with my sister and a very poor one with my mother so it's almost like not having any family anymore sometime take a shower pretty good I guess it was a couple months ago and I was a friend that kind of flipped out on me that would be the situation I wish I did handle it differently infidelity that's a good question the hardest decision I've ever had to make well I had an amazing cat and if you can imagine it was more than a cat it was like being a very large entity in the body of a cat and my cat passed away and I had to I wanted to have a proper burial at an animal cemetery and have a memorial service for my cat and my mother was against these ideas that was too much for a cat and so it took me two and a half months to come up with the money to find his casket and to decide on what style of casket I wanted because it was so hard to own that decision when I didn't get any support over it but eventually I triumphed and I found an artisan in Tennessee that makes Cedar chests and he made me the most beautiful Cedar casket octagono octagon all with Ivory lining and plush padding on the inside of the casket and the people at the animal Cemetery said that in 20 years of business they'd never seen such a beautiful casket and they'd never seen someone that gave so much to their animal so I felt really really good when I saw the way that I was sort of like a sending my cat and I went to the cemetery then I get erased from my memory I think I have erased a lot of events from my memory well I probably had a lot of them weird experiences definitely no well you know I'm a very determined human being so I work myself into being in positive states of mind but overall I think that definitely realizing I have some deep depression and essentially I just need more of a support network here in La I need to create a new family and that's basically what I need to renew a really do which is difficult because it's hard to have a family and family and friends you know people that you can really really trust and it's just hard to get around La without a car so I feel a lack of support in my life and I feel isolated and lonely other than that I'm very optimistic any changes yeah I walk to work which is in Beverly Hills and I walk through Beverly Hills and I noticed that even though I'm walking around nice places I'm a joyless when I'm walking to work doesn't really make me that happy makes me happier when I get to the commercial part and there's more people around and there's lots of kind of like activity and shops it does nothing for me like walking through the neighborhoods I noticed I noticed that I have a lot of lethargy in my body which is depression I'm really working hard at going to sleep before midnight and I noticed that it makes a big difference when I do get enough sleep I'm fine I'm just tired but I think I'm pretty fine energy-wise in terms of interacting with other people PTSD no yes recently lethargy lack of Joy lack of community lack of close bonds lack of focus support network no one to talk to not a lot of energy to do extra things that would you know help make your life better it's just sort of get into the struggle of just getting through the day and then trying to find the energy to do something to make it better I need to buy something yeah I think I know what my overall trigger what the overall thing is but it's deeper than the overall thing itself that makes any sense well I you guys are going to think I'm a complete whack job but honestly I'm really not I called my mother yesterday and I left her a message and at the end of the message I said I love you and that's a month since she called me which was my birthday when she called me I didn't answer but she didn't say she loves me the year before that she didn't even call me on my birthday and she said she wasn't feeling well and we had a falling out in November so I haven't spoken to her since the following out but essentially what I realized in November was just a tremendous amount of inability to love that she has towards me and I think it's a lifelong thing so I think it's hard for me to get close to people and to bond with people because if you can't trust your mother who can you trust and if you haven't received love from your mother and you don't know really how to receive Love Actually something about receiving lover receiving self-worth or validation or something like that I think that lack of support you know throughout my whole life regardless of how ambitious or determined I am the there's an underpinning really everyday you know of sadness about that not having a mother and so that's I think the main challenge to workout in my psyche or Soul or emotions something like that how do I cope with my emotions well I sit with them alone mainly since there's no one to share the deeper ones with that would really understand me there was no long-term relationships but I do interact with my emotions a lot when I'm turning my instrument and in acting class and so that's a big you know workout emotionally a couple months ago I went through a patch where I didn't have a place to stay and ended up staying with someone that I thought was the student friend she turned out to be crazy and I had to leave there and as a result I had to seek counseling / the Mandate of my school that's the incident that triggered it yes therapy is useful it's a reflective experience so your reflective throughout the week before you see your therapist and then you sort of start thinking on a deeper level about a seam occurrence seeing that's like what's really the issue and then it feels very look forward to having someone to talk to you that can really listen so the gift of active listening and then feeling of satisfaction from another human being caring about you your welfare and having someone to talk to you on a deeper level when I was in my acting class which was well I took some classes I audited some classes last week and it does moments lot of joy, and when I was at my school studying which was at two and a half months ago who's been a positive influence in my life that would be the most positive influence was my cat's Benjamin and my former partner and no best friends at the moment I went to UCB and saw Improv I'm most proud of my care for my cat and I'm most proud of my relationship with my cat and I'm most proud of that I have been making a lot of progress in a working on my career stuff and I have a positive attitude even though it's very difficult growing up with the family that doesn't give you the kind of emotional or financial support so grown up with a lot of jealousy and negativity and lack of support you're welcome goodbye with very gradually rising, very trembling, low, small pitched voice",1

really hot totally different food style culture they go out to bars and restaurants a lot later stays open later and you know something new exciting and you know I look forward to seeing other types

show a lot of emotion and we're not is as loving you know over the phone or in person but you know we have other ways to show our emotions yeah I usually I'll just watch a movie or go to the movies go to the park I have a small dog so I like taking him around the block so that they usually relaxes me a bit how are you I'm usually pretty good I don't really get extremely angry very often and I keep a lot of my emotions inside which isn't always good but you know I never have crazy angry outbursts and get violent or anything like that when was the last the last time I argued with someone was a few weeks ago we are actually in Las Vegas and you know we were with a big group of people and we are just trying to decide where to go and one of my friends was pretty adamant about one place and it was unappealing to the rest of the group so you know I got a little confrontational but everything worked out in the end tell me about I think the passing of my my mom's dad I wish I would have been a little more loving and an emotional to my mom about it you know it was a very difficult time for her friend I should have been there a little bit more than I was I feel guilty about just not being as as loving and caring to my parents I mean they've they've done a lot for me and provided a lot and I don't know he's really show my appreciation to them I think as much as I wish I should so tell me about the hardest decision the hardest decision I ever something that I wish was erased would certainly be when I was pulled over for a DUI very embarrassing moment but you know I wish that it never happened have you ever seen how have you been feeling lately I've been a little bit sad I had another death in the family recently my uncle passed away a couple weeks ago so it's been a little bit difficult on all of us and you know we're all spread out around the country so it's stuff we can't really you know be together in person so makes it difficult how do you notice I just recently I mean I think I've been a little a little more bummed out and you know down a little bit more than you know normal so you know I'm sure it'll turn around soon but some of these things just take time to heal tell me more about that well you know whenever you lose someone close to you in a family you know it's very difficult for everyone and the you know different people show their emotions differently so you know for me I tend to keep a lot of it in and then I'll be a little more beneficial if I was able to express it to someone more but you know I don't really feel comfortable doing that all the time so hopefully things get better how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep it's very difficult cuz I work a lot of strange hours to so I'm up in a working late and then got to get up early and sometimes I can sleep in more so you know if I'm not in a set routine it makes it a little more difficult but you know I usually get a decent amount of sleep as often as possible so I usually don't have too much trouble in that sense what are you fell asleep while I'm usually a little just bit more irritable more grumpy you know smaller things can set me off a little bit but you know I have certain techniques to relax a little bit more so you know whenever that happens I'm I'm usually able to handle myself appropriately have you ever been diagnosed with no no when is the last time the

pace what are some things you don't cost of living is pretty expensive you travel a lot not recently I traveled mostly while I was in the military why the military is always on the go so most of the travel being so expensive I could only afford it through traveling on Military business for the military or outside of the military what you said akademiks foreign languages private security okay what's your dream job probably in the same industry private security that would be high paying or something along the lines of mental health for something like what we're doing right now was it helps provide for the family pay the bills you consider yourself more shy more outgoing than shy well I'm I watch TV and spend time with my family very good actually very very controlled I have two in my field it was with my wife and it was about finances wish you would that's a good question I believe I coming to California and leaving my oldest daughter's in Florida tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had leaving the military it was for finances and and I knew I had to go so I 1997 I made the choice and all I had known was the military so that was pretty hard tell me about Nevada probably some of my past before the military I was in a relationship not a not a girlfriend boyfriend relationship I was basically victimized by my mother I wish I could erase that but in a way it kind of makes me who I am yes almost 9 years US Air Force 18 years old had no other choice it was either go in the military or stay out on the streets in New York City I had no money for college and no chance of getting a good job so I enlisted are you happy you did that yes absolutely probably the best choice Inn in fixing my life growing up that I ever made three separate times yes I had some Growing Pains at first it was a little bit difficult in the beginning but I adjusted private security and then law enforcement it gave me a sense of sense of regimentation it gave me structure that I wouldn't have otherwise gotten and I believe as far as within people and in just the the general population that does set you aside with set you apart alright I guess in a bit of a struggle sometimes just seeking employment and it's very difficult especially with the way things are have you noticed any changes in your not really just trying to trying to land that dream job as you said before pretty easy especially if I've been active throughout the day and that's usually every day what are you like tired first of all and can't concentrate well yes I have long time ago my goodness 19 90 1992 1992 cold sweats nightmares night terrors disorientation waking up not knowing where I am things of that sort are you triggered by something not that I'm aware of it was it was almost mostly following one of my combat experiences in South America I went to Columbia one on President Bush's War on Drugs and we had the wait we had to live in the jungle and while in the jungle we also had to take a couple of lives while we were there we so that was one of the three instances that I saw Combat Action I learned a long time ago that you have to put your past behind you so I I just do I had to put it behind me it was not easy but it was the right thing to do and it was so That Others May Live so it was it may not have felt right at the time but it was the right thing to do what country is this in the military when you have a combat-related experience you always go through a debrief at the debrief you are asked if you need help coping with the situation so of course I immediately raised my hand told him I need help with coping with the situation it took roughly about want to say somewhere around three weeks to a month of seeing a therapist and once they they gave me some key exercises to do the the acuteness of the night terrors in the nightmares went away it was at first and very seldom am I bothered by it now because it was so long ago no absolutely not why did you stop I didn't need it anymore I learned enough coping skills that we're good enough to be able to cast that aside and not depend upon any facet of treatment or anything else you feel therapy in Haysville yes I do feel it is throwing medication at that kind of problem sometimes it's necessary but in my case I don't feel it is and I will not be dependent upon medications but the therapy 100% I agree especially speaking to somebody when I'm one it does help can you tell me about that tell you about the therapy and how effective it is I don't go to therapy anymore I only went for a months after my Combat Action in Columbia when was the really happy about 3 weeks ago can you tell me about that it was on payday didn't have very many positive role models of very few especially in my childhood I had a lot of negative examples on what not to be so positive role models are probably say most of my superiors in the military that was my biggest growth experience in my life how'd

I say I'm still trying to complete a college education now at age 47 so almost 30 years ago on by but I'll get it yes it's the best of the best experience best thing I've ever done for myself but joining the Army I still paying dividends it it's my living today's helps me pay my bills today my pension that I receive taught me a lot I got to got to meet people from all over the country see places that I've never seen before getting a lot of opportunities did you ever see combat no I did not how easy was it for you it's a little of this a bit of a struggle you know when you serve in your car after you get used to being regimented and having a place to be every day and then all of a sudden you're free basically in and you don't don't have that that discipline in your life anymore so it's it's hard to to readjust I think it took me a long time longer than I realized see I was a security guard I worked in the bakery at a Safeway store that I install carpet and floor coverings for about 10 years or better working retail that's a lot of different jobs all right how did serving in the military change you gave me a lot of self-confidence I was never a very athletic inclined but that's the most physical activity that ever had I develop my body develop my mind show that much metal 42.

back in the 70s but not combat for saying not not armed combat most of it it was great cuz the last like I said the last 18 months was right here in and I live Los Angeles Los Angeles County so it was basically a 9 to 5 job to me so I had no problem going back in the transition anyway what were the six years that I was in the service I saved a lot of money u.s. savings bonds of course so I saved enough money to be able to relax for a couple years to decide what I really wanted to do and that's when I decided to go back to college get a couple degrees saying manufacturing mechanical engineering quality engineering and I've been doing that 79 it's been pretty productive productive I pride myself and the knowledge and experience I picked up over the years to do after the military machinist machinist engineering quality control quality assurance it's been quite a lot it made me realize I had a future instead of just when I was younger you know just kicking around thinking you were going to live forever and not really focusing on anything for the future you got the military has been a very good benefits touch with the GI bills back then like I said it paid for your education so I had that option and I took that option you're sorry to hear that but I took the option to use the GI bill for my education fire during their I'm going through some side effects with my new inhalers I have a COPD bronchitis chronic bronchitis and they've been giving me some dizzy spells and coughing spells in the morning when I get up and have to take these inhalers and it really it exhaust you it takes a lot out of you but I'm getting up there and unfortunately I'm still smoking on the lighter side of that I'm not as smoking as much as I used to but other than that I'm doing pretty good I'll be moving out of US Vets in a couple of months and I need to pick up with the pace on that to find an apartment have you noticed any change no I'm still focused it before work focused on getting into a permanent residence how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep usually it's usually it's pretty easy I have those times when I'm tired to the point of where it's hard to fall asleep and sometimes I can just go to sleep right away how long does thinking of maybe something that happened during the day like you mentioned earlier in this conversation things I could have handled better things I could have done a little differently what are you like Trump fired little grouchy I guess a little grouchy but a cup of coffee and I'm usually through it and over it no back before I go to the service I was diagnosed with what do they call it bipolarism but I never really thought much about it did you know you get up when you get down last Saturday when I went to go deep sea fishing got a really nice red snapper that was about that be where was what With Friends my grandfather Oasis spend a lot of time with him on summer vacations when I was a teenager my dad was in

158,669,"I just say I don't feel like I'm not I'm ready to rock and roll are we on camera is it a she or he oh there she has where's your face we're not going to see your face wow her seen this before so once again I ministered her up and then went to after she's done she'll tell you the environment pretty cool I'm not a therapist but I'm here and please I'm fine oh I'm feeling pretty good I had a little I was a little bit I wasn't sure what to expect when I got here but I feel pretty comfortable now I feel fine I'm very upbeat and in a good mood and happy Feeling Good great where are you from originally I'm from New Jersey born and raised in New Jersey went to basic training in New Jersey at Fort Dix drafted into the army when I was 17 well I don't like it's just too crowded in La there's just too many people and it's just everybody to rush rush and I like a little more slow-paced but I do like the weather here so that's where I'm here and my family is here that's what brought me here do you travel a lot I traveled when I was younger when I got out of the military because I wasn't sure exactly what I was looking to do with my life and but now I'm kind of settled in and going to school for culinary arts in Hollywood and I have a fiance who graduated from USC and I'm pretty happy with my life but traveling not too much anymore now what do you enjoy about going to new places and meeting new people and seeing other parts of the country I haven't been to Europe but I hope to get there someday especially about it for credit number years I lived in Louis in New Orleans Louisiana took a trip there and enjoyed the food was fantastic and the music was fantastic and the weather was great and I loved it there and I took a truck back taking a trip to Las Vegas because I used to be a gambler at one time but not anymore that's about it I'd rather not talk about that well I'm currently enrolled in a culinary arts school but I got my GED in the military and so now I'm taking a culinary arts to be a chef I hope to open up a restaurant someday I'm going to school I'm going to school in and I work part-time my dream job is to own a bed and breakfast with my fiance that's my dream job and I hope to make that come true within the next year or two do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing probably more shy than not going I was much I was very shy when I was growing up but I'm still shy but I'm trying to break out of my shell so to speak well my mom and dad are no longer with us they passed on and I have a sister in Northern California we were never close so we don't communicate very much and which is probably partially my fault parsley her fault we just don't seem to have a lot in common to show my mom passed away and that was pretty rough she was pretty sick by dad passed away about 9 years ago from Alzheimer's so we had a good relationship. to relax I just like to go take walks take long walks on the beach read a book watch live sports on TV I love the outdoors so I love to get out and exercise whenever I can that's what I do how are you very good very good very good I don't have a temper I don't get mad very out it takes a lot for me to get very very mad at somebody I'm cutting easygoing guy no no not really and I I try to avoid trouble whenever I can sometimes you can't avoid it but I try I'm fine probably arguing about with my roommate about making too much noise when he gets up in the morning and you know silly things like that but when you live in that kind of environment you have to learn to live with other people and it's kind of rough but you do the best you can I like you. I don't really want to discuss that later would rather not I'd rather avoid that question all right what's something you feel guilty about probably not getting enough education when I was younger and I had problems in school and running away from home when disappointing my family things like that I had a bad childhood due to my fault though she not theirs but I made the wrong decision which I'm paying for now so but we have to move ahead the hardest decision I had to make was putting my mom to rest thought that was the hardest and it's been about 2 years now but I'm still not over that one so that was the hardest she was my best friend so now she's gone my early years before I went into the military I didn't have many friends I was very shy very bad in school I wish I would have paid more attention I probably in better better position now but it's too late to worry about that now so we have to move on and with the acquisition support and help with my fiance that's what I'm doing have you ever served in the middle yes I was in the Army in Vietnam back in the day when I was 17 how is your food service worker in the military many years ago 17 I was drafted 19 7 / 70 or 71 I can remember it's been a long time I was drafted I didn't have a choice and really so how was drafted so I went in the army which was a good experience actually yes I am yeah and now I'm getting help from the military so that's a good thing no I was Stateside all the time I was in the military I was stationed in New Jersey Georgia Texas that's right I'm respected Fort Hood Texas it was well do the fact that I didn't go overseas or she combat it was fairly easy you know it was hard leaving home at that young age but it was fairly easy I didn't have much, I had some problems in the military but I missed him a lot and miss my family but it was okay it was a good experience I'm glad I did it that's when I started traveling traveling a lot because I didn't know are we still young and I wanted to see the country and travel around work here work there good job you got a job there just thought I should have been going to the school and while I was young and getting it having a decent job now instead of starting at the age of 60 but they say it's never too late so here I am I'll be okay I'll be alright well it turned me into a man that's for sure yeah and maybe become no more responsible learn to take learn to be on my own well I have my good days and bad days because I'm on this new medication for depression so some days I don't feel good and I have other medical issues I have breathing problems and I have some other medical issues but most of the time I feel pretty good but there are they there are good days and bad days I just take it one day at a time have you noticed any changes well I just know I don't sleep well matter fact I hardly sleep at all which is not good and then like I say I have my depressing days and days where I just don't have any energy and don't feel like doing anything and then I have my good days with my fiance to go to the best because she's my pride and joy without her I don't know where I'd be how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep very difficult very difficult about 3 to 4 hours a night last night I woke up at about 3 in the morning and I never could go back to sleep that's not good but yeah my sleeping is very bad it seems to get worse and worse everyday I'm not quite sure how I guess just I don't have the answer to that question I don't know never used to be that way all right I don't know well I have no energy and I get grouchy I'm very restless tired of course because I haven't slept I do the best I can have you ever been diagnosed I'm not sure what that is I don't know what that is well I don't know what that is I was never diagnosed with anything but you know they want to put me on some sleeping pills but I try and stay away from as much pills as I can I really don't like to take a lot of medications but there's some medications I have to take such as I have medications for my anxiety and my depression things like that I have to have those but other than that I'd rather stay away from medications if possible well I have the I have anxiety attacks that I've had for the last three or four years would you put me in the hospital but as long as I stay up on my medication I'm okay but I have stomach problems I'm just other issues so it's just a day-to-day thing I deal with it the best I can I don't know I'm not an I really don't know I just like I started do some problems when I was losing my I thought I was losing my eyesight because I had my iPod with popping out to do a thyroid problem I had and so they put me on this medication that I can't get off of now I've been on it for about 4 years 5 years and I'll probably out the rest of my life I have to take it twice a day or I will end up in the emergency room which I have before but I'm okay all right how do you cope with them I just try and I just deal with it the best I can go out and take a walker engaging some physical activities you know go to the beach like I said before and things like that keep my mind occupied how's the best way okay well because I wasn't sure what was wrong with me and I was just because I was feeling sick every day which is not natural so I had to go see a doctor psychiatrist not because I'm crazy just because I needed some help some medication and they gave me this medication that they did tell me that it was addictive and it's highly addictive and I've been on it for like I said about four years now and I'll probably be out of the rest of my life so but it keeps me feeling okay I can deal with things well I have an appointment tomorrow is a psychiatrist and yes I do not that often as long as I keep on my medication I'm okay do you feel therapy is useful well the last time I was in therapy with the psychiatrist all they did was it wasn't very much of a help because they were talking to me about my family and things like that and they weren't really helping me any so I don't go to therapy that often it's not a regular thing I just go to see a psychiatrist and that was the first time I've gone and it just all session lasted about 10 minutes how's your family where they live blah blah blah blah blah blah nothing about me and my problems and I never went back so I do have an appointment tomorrow with a different psychiatrist to see if I can get some more help and because I find Working is very hard because of my problems with my stomach and my breathing and if so I'm trying to hopefully get on some disability you know I'm 60 years old and finding a job especially in these times is not that easy so we'll see what happens because I don't I need it I need some income you know and I can't be little bit too young to retire so I need to be put on disability so hopefully I get some help none actually none sad to say but it's true like I said I don't go on a regular basis so it's been a while I will see what happens tomorrow when was the last I feel pretty happy right now and we want I want to wish my fiance I'm always happy because she's a very puppy positive person and we're in love and nothing like being in love so that's what I'm most happy when I'm with her because we have a lot in common and we have fun together I love her she's very supportive yes

don't have many Family Values me and my brother 13 years apart in age so I really don't know my brother that well so I really don't know much of a family life we never sat down at the table together and had meals together it was always like separate times when we come in and eat another one would come in and eat we never sat down at the same table so I don't know much about family life I listen to music and I listen to relaxing relaxation music like Chimes a brook water running stuff like that how are you I'm on medication right now I get aggravated really easily mood swings personality disorder but sometimes it just flares up depending on the situation of somebody gets in my face but I try not to let it happen cuz I know the circumstances when was the last time you argue with them Wheels on the Bus I was sitting in the back on the bus and the guy came back and he wanted me to move for he could sit down but I'm a big guy and he's a big guy so I decided just to get up and let him have a seat I didn't want to get no confrontation I just let it go that had to be meeting a girl that I've known for 18 years she's had two children with this guy and now the guys going to be part of the family and I feel very comfortable about that but I still have feelings for this girl but I know that the father of the boys but not married he's going to be involved with the family and I I don't like that what's something you feel guilty about that's a good one back in 2010 I went back from my mom's funeral and my brother was hard up for money and he took his Ira out and spend it and I have promised him I was going to pay him back I wasn't able to pay him back and he held it against me so I felt guilty about that because I made a promise and I didn't keep it but there was more circumstances into that and he doesn't understand he didn't write to me he didn't call me he didn't do a lot of things tell me about the hardest decision the hardest decision I ever had to make was when I was with the merchant marines I was very comfortable being at sea and my wife at the time she wanted me to stop sailing and just get a regular nine-to-five job where I would have been very comfortable staying at Sea and working on ships cuz I love that that was what I loved but she didn't like that so she'd rather me work 9 to 5 tell me about new bed or something that you wish you could erase from your memory dead bodies I always see a lot of dead bodies I had circumstances in the military where I recovered a dead body in the Philippines a boy had jumped ship and we recovered the body underneath the pier and I had to pull the body out and put it in a body bag and another incident was in boot camp there was a circumstances were me and this guy got letters all the time from our girls but he was engaged and he committed suicide because the girl dumped him for another guy and a crush them and he end up jumping 3 ft in front of me while I was in Barracks Duty and I seen his head explode like pumpkin and it affected me greatly I see that all the time have you ever served in the middle yes I was in the Navy 15 years into with the merchant marines 24 family thing my father was in the Navy my cousin's was in the Air Force my other uncle was in Marine Corps I just wanted to serve my country are you happy you did that yes I love my country USA serve in the military no ragrets I know but we escorted Kuwaiti tankers in the Gulf we had the weapons pointing at us while we escorted Kuwaiti tankers in the Gulf but I never saw combat was never in the combat situation never had a fire a gun at somebody so I don't know what it was like what I'm traveling through is going through is non combat PTSD which means I was in a combat zone at first it was hard I was collecting unemployment for 18 months then after the unemployment ran out I had to get a job so I got various jobs working security and refineries and I tried to stay busy the best I could it was okay I worked refineries I worked security I worked for wineries security guard for wineries I did a little odds and ends I was able to get a full-time job and that was with the merchant marines I went to the Coast Guard and apply for set g m e d I forgot but anyway I worked for engineering how did serving in the military change you made me a better person I was in a scared when I first joined I was kind of scared but then we join the military and made me a lot tougher and stronger I stood up for my own grounds I wasn't being pushed around and I just like people applauding when you would walk

you feel guilty about not being more available to my son tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had wow that's a tough for me I've been following the hardest decision oh there was no decision in this this is but something that I'd like to relate erased from my memory was in that accident with my brother a long time ago I wish that had never happened to him have you ever seen yes 18 baby didn't think so at the time though I just wanted to do something and that's what I did are you happy yes not at first but in hindsight looking back yes did you ever think in a manner of speaking I was in Korea when they stomped one of my Majors to death and from that point forward everywhere we went we went fully loaded meaning armed with ammunition no actual engagement With the Enemy though or what other personality or whatever you call it how is the weather very I never left it I was there as a worker and just really was a pretty much the same as just changing jobs now to do after the military went back to the job that I had before when I was working with the u.s. steel what is serving in the military change you don't know if it did if it did I have to say that gave me a appreciation or the opportunity to work with stuff that I never probably would have worked with him so I travel a little bit around the world and we're working on the Korea and that may be more aware and appreciative of all of the things that are out there I got a chance to see him and touch him a little bit how have you been feeling lately depressed no but I'll try to I living environment where people are insecure so homeless and environment and there's a lot of stress that goes along with that if you're trying to do something that's a lot of you know you're beautiful you don't you're not sitting with the other people because the downtrodden and that makes it stressful yes can you tell me about that depression and frustration with basically almost everybody that I've tried to confide in turned out to be treacherous and just not trustworthy or dedicated recently the same size if I get a lot of sleep in my own opinion but I think probably less focused less able to focus but not getting sleep lately has been tough or go to sleep okay but I just wake up in a few hours then back to sleep you probably a lot of other things too okay have you ever been diagnosed with p no yeah that was one of the questions on there but it is it needs clarification and that's why I checked know on that yes but it was I was part of an experiment with taking interferon and ribavirin to try to cure hepatitis and those those two drugs cause depression so I was chemically depressed as opposed to clinically and as a difference so there was some the psychiatric help and some medication to help me get beyond that 311 months of treatment with that it was tough don't recommend it to anybody interferon is a killer don't do it that treatment ended probably and all of the symptoms with it probably 3 to 5 years ago 3 years ago I think nightmare has intense itching thoughts of suicide and Vivid terrifying nightmares that's interferon interferon and ribavirin to drugs that they used to treat cancer and also in the treatment of hepatitis-c currently in addition to a third drug that they used can't think of the name of it how do you cope with them well I seem to be okay now has skin damage my body broke out in a full-body rash cause intense itching full full Ian golf the body for intense itching almost made me jump out of window but I held on the itching we're talkin about chemical cause being chemically induced as opposed to psychologically okay you still go to therapy now no do you feel therapy most worthless piece of crap I have a 20 out of 10 therapist that I talk to whoever said that the VA maybe to actually knew what they were doing or and then two were sincerely concerned about what they were doing the rest was just collecting a paycheck show me more about that well they were incompetent just asking foolish questions why I'm even we were supposed to be talking about some of my personal things in life and she was playing little games like sitting a person purposely leave the person on the table to see your nose still use using Psychology 101 the book bad about through the by the Numbers at the way that she was taught to proceed with someone as opposed to actually knowing how to proceed with someone if they just it was it was it was a funny actually actually funny sad that is over but the changes since going to therapy nothing you know all of that depression stuff kind of eased off and so I'm back to trying to do the things that I was doing before I took that 11 months to go in that experiment okay when is the in a long time I usually get a little bit of that daily somewhere I get a little bit of happiness in here just a little just enough to keep me saying I think there are elected without being you know listing of the risk of being casciac my father but other than that of positive influence in my life have been many mostly the men that I worked with while working it was a younger man there was some of the best the best work experience I've had in my experience is my 30 or 40 years of working with the team and ship those men and it was probably the same kinship that you would gain from being in combat because it was dangerous work and these guys looked out for each other they took care of each other I'm pretty sure it's pretty much the same way for a guy that experienced combat and the camaraderie that they had to have with each other because their lives were on the line how do your best friend giving kind nice but I really enjoyed I get a lot of those could be going too many things I enjoy the moment you know driving shopping for an enjoyment in something some kind of way everything I do want to see my son but many accomplishments most proud of in my life been honest you're welcome thank you yes you

Just what it is but I'm always wondering what the next person is going to do when they get that close to me like especially you think in a crowded room where you can't move around as much and you know I'm always watching the whole everything trying to see who's going to do what and when usually I try and get away from the crowd you know that's how I cope with them that I usually just trying to get away from the crowd not focus so much on it but it ain't hard specially if you got to be there but yeah I just kind of stay to myself and watch everything moving okay A friend of mine who I used to serve in the Navy with he told me I should go I should go and actually check out what's going on with my back but when I got in there I start talking to the first place I went was the mental health ward and told him what was going on with me, attitudes in my harmful thoughts to other people and that's what got me here but I got to say a friend of mine suggested that I go yeah yes I do well my last therapy session was about a week or two ago but I'm getting scheduled to go back into therapy yeah yeah yeah it's it's slow me down you know I'm not so quick to want to hurt nobody no more I'm not so while still defensive but I don't look at it is I want to go and you'll saying put do physical harm the young saying certain people just for being around three more about what we want to hurt people it's a weird feeling I don't know how to describe it it's kind of like describing the taste of milk to somebody it's just anybody I'll be walking in the hallway and a minute I'm looking at them I'm figuring what kind of if I had to encounter that person how would I physically disabled them you know do you know the saying don't show come out do I just strike him in the throat poker I don't say break a leg or arm or something you'll just how can I incapacitate this person it's a trip I'm telling you the alternative just had a thought all the time with a complete stranger who really doesn't pose a threat to you is true so I'm a little more tolerant I don't fly off the handle as much as I used to you know stuff that used to piss me off like you don't say little things I don't really get too upset about a may have sent me but my reactions of different I don't like I said I don't explode cuz everything I mean the smallest thing with send me mail saying over the top but not so much no more you know it's kind of breathing take it in stride or try to you know so yeah it's just it's working it helps oh man really happy oh my God may all that has been some years it's been some years I can't even really put a finger on what I actually felt really happy so you know cuz it's always been I might have moments where you don't say everything's cool and it's a good day or whatever but I'm still throughout the day there's they'll still Bostwick creep in and you know I'm saying I'm looking at people this that another thing I'm saying this way and nut so yeah it's been awful long time since I was just genuinely really happy great is it all right if you say so who's the real life somebody's been a positive influence in my life my parents you although we have a problems you know I look up to them they've been through with each other for umpteen years and a positive influence to me I mean outside of that there's a old girlfriend of mine named it don't matter who what name is old girlfriend of mine she's kind of show me how to take life as it comes and you'll not everything's a battle because she's going through stuff that I'll never have to go through you know saying she's terminally ill but yet she still has a smile on her face and you know just keeps it going so I got to take a a page out of her book with that one you know everything's not always all bet how would you describe me that's a good question I really cool you know funny you know but real honest you know and loyal you know crazy are crazy cool loyal fun and you know just all around

Undercover work I did all kinds of different things at one point so that would be my dream job you consider yourself more shy or outgoing right now I feel like I'm outgoing but generally I'm shy when it comes to the two social scenes lot of times I'm shy but right now I don't feel shy right now I feel comfortable talking to you I was adopted so my relationship with my family didn't really go that well so I'm really not close with my adopted family and I don't have limited biological family so I don't really have a lot of family but the the very few that I have I love them very much and I try to spend as much time with him as I can what is the best what do you do I listen to music and I pray I pray I listen to music and imma just meditate on positive things take a walk ride a bike read a book things like that didn't used to be very good at it but throughout the years going through hard times and learning the hard way I've learned to control my temper pretty well now it takes a lot to get me to give me angry I'm more passive now than I ever have been and I I like that about myself when was the last time I argued with my best friend probably wasn't like a real serious argument but we argued a little bit about a religion which I don't like to go into a r i don't like 2 to get into arguments about but unfortunately we got into argument about religion she wanted me to she wants me to join her religion I don't feel like it's right what I should do and I so we got into a little dispute about that better situation that Etsy there's many many many situations that I wish I had it handled differently and one of them was my children I wish I could have been I wish I could have been a better dad to my kids I wish I could have made better decisions for my children and I didn't what's something you feel guilty about my guilt I feel guilty about that about not being a good parent to my kids at many times in my life and that guilt stays with me my whole life everyday I think about it tell me about let's see the hardest dishes decision I've ever had to make I wish I could erase from my memory the last time that having getting divorced would be one of the last things with the memory of that relationship going bad was probably one of the things of the last excuse me one of the things I'd like to erase from my memory the last time I interacted with my ex-wife yeah I was in the Navy how old are you I was 18 just a kid well to be honest with you I was 18 years old and I didn't have anywhere else to go I was homeless and it was either be homeless on the street at 18 or join the military and try to do something with my life and so that's what I chose to do are you happy you did yeah in a way out you know I got out I got out of the military and wish I had stayed in longer so yeah It ultimately I'm glad I did that no never saw combat I was in an 80 86 and 87 those years and I was in the Cold War era I was stationed on the and my ship was dry dock for a little while so I didn't I didn't see combat they didn't have combat at that time how easy was it for you to go I think it was too easy for me I just did actually I just did real well getting out and and I'm getting back into civilian life I went in with it with both feet running and so yeah it was it was wasn't hard at all alright what did you do after the military I work several different jobs looking didn't thinking about what career I wanted to choose I apply for the sheriff's department didn't make the sheriff's department but got into working for different private investigative companies at that time and that's how I ended up working and getting into Workman's Comp fraud and different surveillance and investigative aspects of a private investigation so I work 5 investigation a little time after getting out of the military how did serving in the military change you it taught me honor atami dignity you taught me respect it it taught me how to to Listen and Obey chain of command it kind of grew me up a GroupMe app from a kid to a man in a lot of ways like I said I wish I had stayed in longer to have grown more but I did how have you been feeling lately lately I been feeling just really I don't know just kind of worthless you know depressed a lot kind of a little bit worthless. Feeling like I don't know maybe a little bit a little lack of Hope in a lot of ways not knowing what my future holds and I guess you could say and I don't know just feeling a little down in the last couple weeks have you noticed any changes in her behavior yeah this feeling kind of hopeless and just depressed and not having a lot of energy and and like I said just feeling down just feeling just feeling down about myself now not feeling worthy you know those kind of feelings all right how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep depends on the night sometimes I I sleep really well other nights it's Restless I have bad dreams things like that but lately I've just been kind of feeling depressed I've been sleeping too much what are you sometimes I get irritable I can't think straight I might my mind's a jumble are you I just can't think straight and and irritable and may be cranky things like that yes yes I am actually take medication for to get counseling for it and I've been dealing with that for a little while now but yeah I have been diagnosed with PTSD how long ago when he died nice excuse me several years ago my earphones coming off a little bit but yeah several years ago Tremors at night nightmares depression feeling feeling low something something bad is going to happen to me at all times you know that's how I felt when I was in the military I feel like our ship was going to be bombed anytime just being feeling a sense of Terror a lot of the time are they triggered by something no that's the strange part about it it's just it's just the way I feel I don't know why it's like that I can't tell you but it's it's it's the way the way I've been feeling for 4 years ever since I was in the military I feel that way now like we're going to get bombed something's going to happen at any moment a cast is going to break out things like that and I can hate it I wish it was like that which I didn't think that way how do you cook with them isolate sometimes and and try to I pray I believe in God so I pray and I try to get him to comfort me in and help me to get through the the scary feelings I feel and I try to get support from the little friends I have in the few family members I have and I just try to tell myself everything's going to be okay it's it's not what I'm thinking you know things aren't the way I think they're they are in my head those those kind of coping mechanisms I couldn't take it anymore I was having a still pressing up in the hospital this feeling like I said feeling tired of being scared all the time couldn't I just couldn't deal with it anymore so I ended up getting help and I'm glad I did and it's a day-by-day struggle I still struggle everyday to to do Skip by but I basically I'm doing okay I'm hanging in there it's very hard yeah I go to therapy like probably once a month I take meds for it helps me out a lot I probably should be going to therapy more but it's once a month right now all right you feel therapy in Hughesville I think it's useful if you're serious about it and you take it seriously and you have the right therapist and everything is the right Dynamics are there I think it's very useful yeah well I think that if you if you go if you're going just to go it's not going to help if you're going to seat the true answers to get help I think it's it's going to it's going to work it's good you're going to get help it's good things will work out but if you've got the wrong person to talk to their that the chemistry is not there or the education or whatever Dynamics are involved aren't working they're not in sync with each other either on your side of the of the therapist is there is going to be more difficult for the for the solution to be a positive when I think I don't know I I I don't know if I said that properly but basically yeah let's sort of changes have I noticed I'm more of a positive person actually that I that I ever have been was completely negative about everything for so many years I'm more positive I have more hope even though I have days of hopelessness more hope I feel more secure Within Myself and I feel like I've got a release I've got somebody that I could talk to that will then understands me and somebody that could really relate with when is the you know I don't remember the last time I was very happy to be honest with you I don't remember it's a I don't remember it's been a long time let's see my brother my older brother he's a real positive influence in my life my best friend she's a rub super positive person in my life every time I start

you I'm Pasadena hi the weather I love the weather I love the people there so many things to do in LA I love La you know it's my home and I wouldn't live anywhere else traffic the traffic that's probably the biggest thing is getting a little crowded that's it when I was in the military at job with a lot I haven't traveled too much in the past few years but I'm looking forward to doing some more traveling soon what do you enjoy about eating eating new foods eating different type of foods depending on where I go maybe the nightlife clubs and stuff like that and just going somewhere new you know cuz culturally I appreciate differences so I'd like to hear about what one of my trips Japan you know when I got to Japan only stayed for 6 months but you start to learn more about yourself I learn more about myself as an American by going overseas and understanding that just because I'm American and I'm from this country this is not the only country in the world in millions of people billions of people actually live a lot different from my dude from we do and just learning to appreciate the differences you know and appreciate myself to but the trip itself you know actually 6 months is not long enough I think where you go to a foreign country for me because at the six-month Point that's exactly when I started to I really wanted to just wanted to stay but it was time to come back so then again like I said traveling food Customs just learning more about other cultures and it's real exciting this it's it's not to mention educational but I think it's needed I think a lot of Americans are a lot of my family members would never been able to go out of the country need a trip somewhere you know I don't know if America to really understand their place in the world I will probably actually flying to Japan in flying over Alaska the mountain tops in Alaska I need the mountain ranges are so huge and they were all covered with snow but it look like we were close enough to actually put our hands out of the plane and touch the top of us you know snow capped mountains I thought that was really exciting what you study at school I was a criminal justice major now I work in the medical field actually dream job and actors being an actor that would be a dream job I'll going tell me about your relationship with your family well I have one brother and two sisters I'm close to my younger sister she just had the first grandchild in the group of my siblings you know a couple of years ago so I haven't had a few she lives in Oregon my other sister lives here in the LA area my brother lives in Oakland I would like to visit I would like for us to all be together you know more than we are but we're not so we do the best we can but the relationship is pretty strong my mom she lives down in San Diego and I try to talk to her at least once a week and get to go down and see her every every now and then my father passed away in 04 and for the extended family will usually get together on holidays Manny Thanksgiving Christmas and keep in contact like everybody else now on Facebook sometimes when I'm feeling I turn on I'll go to the gym go to the gym or maybe you know sometimes now as I'm getting older I realize when I take a nap that kind of helps me to relax wake up refreshed and ready to go how are you in control I'm pretty good at controlling my temper you know like everyone else I have I've got pet peeves and if it's one of the peeves that might tend to get a little angrier than some of the other things that you note in the bother me but overall I control my ankle pretty well when was the the last argument wow I don't remember situation that I would have handled differently I've seen I had a laptop and that I was over a acquaintance home and my laptop disappeared and I didn't get angrier and you know I didn't I was just really too, nonchalant about the whole incident and as I look back on it I should have probably be and should have been more assertive about them finding my laptop for you know finding out what happened and I kind of just let that go and didn't say much that's something you feel guilty about I feel guilty about not working out as often as I see it the hardest decision I ever had to make I haven't had any hard decisions I'm hard decisions staying in LA and not moving back to Philadelphia that was a hard decision you know I lived in Philadelphia for a couple years and I moved back home but I wanted to move back but I did and I stayed here you know that was a hard decision tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from probably the abuse my father exhibited towards my mother as a child yes 18 by the members of my family has been in the military and I don't think I was ready for college at that point so I actually sign the papers when I was 17 for the delayed entry program and winning after graduation are you happy yes extremely did you ever see cow no combat no how easy was it for you made the transition was more difficult than I anticipated it was strange even though I had been in the military for those years and I had really become a different type of person and it took a little while but it happens they have a thing called separation for about the last two months before you're discharged where I kind of helps you get ready or prepared you back to get into civilian life so it takes a little while but it's it's it it happens it takes a while some people takes longer you know some people didn't take us long so I went to school how did serving in the military change you it allowed me to mature I don't think I'm I don't know if I would have gotten that when I went to college right after high school or not but it allow me to also be on my own and kind of find out who I was and grow up so how have you been feeling lately been feeling great you know I I don't have any worries or complaints have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately

186,712,"so frigginI'm pleased are you okay with this yes yes done pretty good how are you Philadelphia Pennsylvania the weather in Latin culture food music the beaches what's better dirty large parts of it getting violent stuff like that GasBuddy you travel a lot I used to in the Marines and growing up I did y'all all over the east coast and around the country out same thing different different types of people different types of food different types of music seeing different architecture and things like that the east coast and the west coast is very different in terms of how we build our buildings so just different places that you go you see different things like that turkey we visited the oldest church in the world I believe it was called the oldest church in the world they have those the towers the towers and just a different people I ate goat and some other types of food that I had never eaten before and I found out the people or are people just like us it's not just like Americans we might have our perception but people from another country they're just the same they just have a different language and they just look different but they don't they're not different you know American Experience I remember everything I have a very vivid memory I remember a lot of things I don't know I was a trumpet player since third grade and I did that in the mornings so I did that for 15 years of my life music warehousing labor can I ride my bike a lot the Los Angeles Philharmonic go to the Boston Pops Orchestra or something like that something big something like that to you Lili outgoing I wish I when I was growing up but not anymore the best of guy yes I I have music I love all kinds of music so if I just put on my headphones that usually helps or I go for a bike ride I have my bike downstairs I'll just go as far as I feel like going 10 15 20 miles and then come home that's very relaxing I don't have a temper I used to put it this way my daughter's mother had a temper and I started to learn it from her but I realize that's but that's not me that that's not the type of person that I am and so I I we separated and I've long since not been like that yeah with her only with her never never like in public or with the police or anything like that I would say that she some girls know that they can use the police they can just say things some girls not all girls and she would do that but no it was never I've never like hit a woman or anything like that no when was the last my former landlady I just moved about two months ago where I was before my my landlady was a drug addict she didn't didn't do anything except drug she didn't fix anything she was just lazy and everything was unkempt and and if you are renting to somebody else I had strong views that you should keep up with the property and I which is build up over time and I told her you know I've been here and I've given you so much money so much money and you haven't done anything except drugs and it was we got a little heated I I don't know because I think the way things end up is the right way in the end if your Zone as you learn so Google I said you have any regrets I don't know I've learned I've learned you can't have regrets cuz y'all at the end of the day you end up in the right place and that's what you have to look at so I don't think so I've learned from the things that I may have but I had to learn to understand I'm sure you do I might as well be honest I know it's looking at it I know you're a person on the other side of that but you don't look like a person but I had a woman that I was chasing and I we were intimate we were together and we were intimate and I shouldn't you know made me promise not to tell anybody at work and I was so excited and I told somebody cuz I thought I could trust that person and I couldn't trust that person and word got out in the hole Restaurant New and she was embarrassed and I broke her trust it was a pretty it was pretty bad but at the same time and again I said that I don't regret things because she admitted she admitted that it hurt and by admitting it heard it kind of said more about the situation if somebody could admit to you that you can hurt them that means they're vulnerable to which said something you know I understand that so I learned something more than maybe had I not done it had I not heard I might not have known tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to probably coming to California my daughter's mother and I like I said we didn't get along and I have a 9 year old daughter who I love and I want the best for so so five years ago she moved out the mother moved out here to meet her new husband and and start a new life and all that and she brought my daughter along and it took me a couple months to get money and everything together for me to do it but I knew when I came out here that I didn't know anybody we're from the East Coast I didn't know anybody I didn't know nothing about California I looked at a map and I said Santa Monica I know that City I'll try to get close to there and when it came time for it like the few days before and I knew I bought a bus ticket and I packed as much as I could and I knew that I was moving to the other side of the country and then I couldn't turn around that that they missed a huge step it was a huge step and I knew why I was doing it but I was terrified I was 10 I got here and I'm still terrified and it took some time to try to get everything together you know to eventually live with a drug addict that I was with but for sure getting up and moving and leaving everything and friends that I knew and starting completely brand new that was that was very difficult a lot of my childhood my parents were abusive and I guess this anonymity thing helps but yeah my parents were my parents were destructive and there's a lot of things that they did to me as a child that that I wouldn't wish on other kids I I've learned that I'm a stronger person but I I still wouldn't wish it on somebody else come stronger and I can help other people because of the things I know but but it doesn't completely justify the stuff that happened to you yes the Marines 19 I was actually going to go to college for music for trumpet and my parents didn't help me with any of the decisions and I didn't know how I was going to get there and I was so adamant about still playing though so I don't know I knew the Marines were something that I could do it would be physical but I could still keep playing and it wasn't going to be so like my parents wouldn't have driven me to college running like that and I had no idea how I was going to make that step I think I fell to the military was going to be an easier step so to speak I don't know if that makes sense but yeah it was more streamlined just to get in the military and keep playing that way are you happy yeah I would say I learned a lot from from my experiences you have no regrets you know what I mean I can definitely say that as a marine having been a marine there's nothing that can break me and I learned that for sure for the military all right did you ever see combat no thank God how is the weather not easy I would I would say that I right how do I join I went to college and pursue that path things would be considerably different yeah the military and one thing they don't tell you they think the whole thing about the GI bill that don't help pay for college but that's for like vocational schools and stuff like that you don't really know that and I'm not a vocational school guy the jobs are quite the same you kind of a little bit older and you already missed that early Windows to get in on a good career so a lot of people don't don't end up where they might have intended to be before they join the military put it that way to do after the military bunch of jobs different jobs telemarketing pizza delivery old phones for Verizon Wireless warehousing of done thanks and of course traveled for my daughter how did serving in the military change you what's the weather like I said no matter what comes on no matter what comes my way I know I I'll be okay and especially physically but just endurance mental endurance after sleeping in the dirt and and waking up in freezing sleeping bags and digging holes and and and sweating to no end and Twenty

It was about why I don't call her enough and when I wasn't calling her enough you got pretty bad there's a lot of them what's something you feel guilty about guilty there's nothing to feel guilty about a lot of them I don't even talk about but being close to my family is one of the things that I never did and I and I and I regret that tell me about the hardest decision ever had I said there was a lot of decision hard decision that I made but I never made them I can say what you can say I took the easy way out maybe tell me about Nevada don't know have you ever yes alright then again not good it's hard to explain don't know how to even start it UPS down depression dealing with going back to school money I hit you can say I hit rock bottom and I'm starting my life over again yeah that's because of no longer doing things that I ain't supposed to do but it's hard can you tell me about that well from a previous addict why do I get to that I don't know I'm not even to share all I know is that I was just doing the wrong things at the wrong time got me to so much trouble now I'm starting over cuz I lost everything but I'm happy about how I'm starting now it's slow but kind of like an adventure at the same time there's a lot of things that I'm thinking about as well a lot of things that I can't forget how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep I can't I'm under sleep meds two types and sometimes I can't even fall asleep it'll take I can't take more than I I'm prescribed but I have problems sleeping why I really don't know why bad dreams past events thoughts to keep on popping up bad mood depression I'm not too sure irritable on edge you can say sometimes I'll be walking around back if I'm tense from worried about something more less worried about falling asleep when I'm sleeping I believe so yes just currently not too long ago currently filing my claim yes that's one thing I didn't been diagnosed with for sure I don't like it I hate it I don't know if I can pull out of it I don't even think the medication that I'm even using even helps I'm still trying to get try different ones apparently there's enough out there that I can go through maybe more than a year ago about a year ago for my depression isolation not really talking with anybody I wouldn't really be so like a people person communication wasn't all time low I will be mainly staying at the house I wouldn't be going out I wouldn't be doing events or doing the things that I would like to do none of us was alone with my addiction as well that's one thing I can't figure out is what the hell trigger though why am I like this why am I actually doing things or did the things that I do or did coming in Natick not communicating with my family I wasn't I wasn't like this before how do you cope with them I don't know the only thing I got on my side of the gym it's the one place that I know I can release a lot of tension that one place where I know I don't have to talk to people but we're all together they're doing the same thing we're all doing the same thing and exercising and getting physically well the only place where I know that I can relax certain events that took place I lost certain loved ones I lost certain relation lost a relationship I don't talk to my family and I think I said that already got in trouble with the law yeah it is you still go to therapy yes I go to a couple of them you feel therapy in Hughesville sometimes sometimes not depending what the the topic is or we're probably talking about the same thing over again the changes that I've noticed maybe a little bit less stress knowing that I have a couple more skills or tools to cope with my depression PTSD not knowing when I'm going to have an outburst controlling myself here in there but it's it's a long process also on my recovery is going to be a forever process when I made up with my girlfriend that was what two days ago we are you and I talked about it with her and she was able to hear me out and I was able to hear her out and we fix things so that was the happiest moment so far that's great my case managers done to my my group sessions and my girlfriend even though it's much of a bitch she is she still good person he asks why I have one best friend right now and it's funny that you have because now that I remember he referred me as a saint which I don't think I do that I don't think I am that but I'm sure everybody's trying to say is that I'm a good person and I'm trying to do right and I don't want to inflict harm on nobody and I just want to get myself put back together and continue on you know start a new life yeah he did tell me something like that and I do consider you my best friend pretty cool they said that what's something you did recently what I really enjoyed

different people I'd like to hear an experience when I went to North Carolina being there for the weekend the atmosphere was great so different beats type lifestyle imagine where to put it up the party life is different there's a lot of clubs over there so I mean I really had a night time during the weekend that I was there made a lot of nice people got laid did you have a good memory my most memorable experience I really don't know which one to pick out for you I've been a lot of places and done a lot of things and a lot of time as far as me having asthma I have an attack it's a lot of things that I do forget but overall my past has been very good diesel technology and learn how to do how to be a repair technician for like the buses diesel trucks anything is running out diesel they've taught me how to repair engines take them apart and put back together troubleshooting electrical work I'm really enjoying it because I like doing things with my hands and the thing is that they're teaching me I can use it for the rest of my life and I really is something that I can probably pass on the others so you know I really like it what do you do now all right now leave the time I ride my bike a lot going to do some parts of LA a lot of time to go to the beach I like Venice and Santa Monica Beach a lot just Ashley just seeing this country and not the country but the city has a lot of places I haven't been I don't have a driver's license but just being able to ride my bike and go over the freedom to go where I want to I really love that all right what's your dream job my dream job motorcycle racing riding a motorcycle Superbike racing that's my dream job me and my family with distant I'm in touch with my dad but as far as cousins and my mom we don't talk sometimes when I'm feeling what is the fastest guy what do you do smoke some weed and go to sleep my zodiac sign is a Taurus so it takes a lot to make me angry but if it's something that I know is someone that done something wrong I just simply try to tell them about it to correct them but being physical I tried not to get into that but you know you got people out there to really don't care about your feelings so sometimes I ain't walking away not dealing with him anymore when was the I'm going through a divorce I just experienced a domestic violence incident where me and her got nervous about who's going to clean the house so I took it upon myself to I punched in the shoulder and call the police on myself if I'm two days in jail I can order the home has been since January or right now I'm working on my divorce I wish the best for her and the family meeting is no hard feelings about it you know and at home if they have an apartment now on they're doing good but I feel that she should have been more friendly about the way we broke up because she changed the locks on the apartment and I didn't get a chance to get any of my like my tools and put paperwork birth certificate and whatnot she still has that but you know I feel like they to pick my life up and continue on you know I don't wish nothing bad about her hopefully she's happy I know that she's with the baby's daddy's come from Louisiana he's staying with her now and you know it is how would I put it I'm not mad about it I'm more hurt the hurt feeling this what it is I just did I wouldn't have got physical with her I felt it there was going this way so I called myself being away from the home a lot and she kind of noticed it but yeah he got me the convinced that you know me being a husband or you know a father figure that I'm supposed to be spending more time with the family so they can I change my perspective but when I done that my daddy call it putting all my ducks in the basket where she's got my social security number you know my information everything I just open myself up to her which have fell today you know it was a waste of time is a bad move but you know Life Goes On you feeling I mean guilt come from doing stuff that you know you shouldn't have done oh I don't do that in life I don't steal I mean live by the Bible so guilt I don't have that Harley decision I just made the decision that actually out of a reaction in a sense it's not hard for me to make a decision that's not like me tell me about Nevada dealing with women their best of the wrong women I know it in the future that you know women are different that the ones who have done such is that individual is not an all-woman type thing but right now in my life I just need the right one I don't like being by myself I felt that me being married would alleviate that but I married the wrong one evidently hopefully that if I decide to take that step again that it be the right one this time because you don't you know you're getting old and time than went by and you can't bring that back yes I'm a veteran okay how have you been feeling lately how I feel I never thought about it but me I feel good I mean I'm healthy I'm just glad you know you my freedom maybe in Black you really think about the fact of your other race being locked up a lot of history and I feel that me I'm doing good so you know to me I'm happy about life my association with women is different I don't like whole conversation with women that don't know like I used to it's hard for me to like how you say start a relationship or friendship rather with a female now when it comes to men I'm not gay and I don't do gay things so we don't get that out of the way but as far as me and you know I don't have friends but when it comes to being advice you know I experienced that a lot of God few students classmates rather that kind of like leaning toward me when it comes to how would you say me helping them and I kind of like get in trouble for that so I guess you would say of me being outgoing I rather think about other people more than myself my dad told me it's time for me to start thinking about me so I'm trying to get my mind into that frame where you know I'm just concentrating on better in life for myself now how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep find out what I had due to doing the day is no problem but I sometimes worry about the next day in about you know what's going to happen or how I'm going to handle it I thought you know you sometimes get the dreaming about how thing is going to be in if it goes to the world you know the dream leads to Didion or a bad situation you'll wake up from it it's not considered a nightmare but my body I wake up and I don't sleep well I not doing today I mean I'm not irritable emotionally unstable but I don't have problems sleeping if I sit too long in one spot and I know that I'm going to be there for more than 30 minutes I can go to sleep it's no problem for me have you ever been diagnosed with no have you been diagnosed no no depression when was the last time when men the ex-wife in a kids wear at the beach we was all having a good time positive influence I really can't think of any way to slow down a floor that would be my daddy I mean you know he's made it to life and then made a lot of good things for people where you can sit back now and not really worried about things you know he just taking his last few days once you know one day at a time in a sense he really concerned about how I'm doing because the time of the seasons I made you know when it gets to the point where I ran into a problem I'll call him and give me advice about it and sometimes I don't do what he asked me to do or tell me to do it make you mad you know you know especially like when it comes to female so I will say my dad my best friend my best friend I'll be there I guess nice wait slow down it's hard to think of that kind of stuff I really don't pay attention to it I'm most proud of but I still have the desire to continue I'm proud of that I mean life's been good okay goodbye to YouTube with very gradually rising, trembling, very high, small pitched voice",0

Nelson Mandela's book with 500 page biopic kind of thing in action making it to the movie but I read it and I was like you know I'm going to check this out so I went to Robben Island which was pretty cool where it was Kept For about 25-30 years and the city reminds me of San Francisco and if you're going to San Francisco but the city reminds me of San Francisco steep Bluffs right off the coast of the Indian Ocean there but I enjoyed it I had a I had a great great time taking in the sights and you get to see a lot of the Dutch Colonial stuff and you know and all that kind of just mix in together and it's a great wine to have a lot of grape Vineyards Vineyards down in that part of the South and Cape Town or just in general are in traveling at school I studied I studied business I studied Finance and Accounting so I I kind of had a minor in military studies are military science is what it was called and undergrad but for the most part I studied finance and in grad school I studied Finance and Accounting I I write and I do Consulting so I do Consulting for finance so I I do about 50/50 riding and then Consultants. my dream job is to be JJ Abrams so that's my dream job actually I would love to do just got to do something more creative flashlight but I consider is creative is is is the thing that interests me is because you get to create all these different packages and bundle them and derivatives that's no different from writing to me you know so it's the same thing so I just want to do something that's kind of creative and that's kind of aligned to just looking at new things in a different way and that's the way I've always been I'm in general Eminem Morven I'm more of an outgoing kind of guy that's just but you know I don't mind you know when I'm home I'm kind I don't turn on the TV and and do whatever I'll pick up a book and I'll read a book as opposed to you know you watching TV or playing Xbox or whatever so that's that's me why because the other stuff doesn't seem it's interesting you know I think there's a lot of things that are really interesting and and and and and usually using your imagination and then picking up a book it's just kind of raw it's just you know Sun filter kind of thing so that's that's me I have a great relationship with my family I have a wife and kids I also have a family is back in Alabama and Georgia and for my immediate family we we know I have to divide my time between that my only interest in my family but we do a lot of great things that are centered around the kids my wife is moral as an East coaster so she's from New York area so we do things that are turn around her and him do things for the kids cuz the kids have interest so we I just tried to balance it and I have my stuff do some kind of last but we do have a lot of diverse interests which is great what do I do to relax I I would my I'd like to go I I like I think I'm pretty good at controlling my temper I'm more of a laid-back kind of guy I mean I'm that kind of guy you know I'm a little bit you know you just you know at some point you know it enough is enough but I I'm pretty I'm pretty polished and how I have done you know you know being an army been an army officer when I was in the military and going through all the cadet training and stuff you really do a lot and how they interact with management and so forth so I'm okay with track with my temper and everybody has their breaking point and what I do to relax I like to go for a walk mostly I like to be outside I probably shan't argue with ya sure I could say I argue with my wife and it probably was about something related to the kids are the kids in money or something like that we have kid at for kids and integrate kids but but kids are a little expensive at times and then so I don't remember what it was but it was a ballet class or something like that and it wasn't necessarily free I'll put it that way and you know so we can if we had an argument about it because she was just one of those things where you know my wife you know you know you know if she if the kids has an interest and anything related to anything you say let's let's invest all of this in it and it's see what happens after while you like okay fine a situation I wish I would have handled differently I would probably okay that's even the hardest decision I've ever had to make was when I was in the Army and I had to fire someone who has been in the service for 15 years that was pretty tough because this person went out and he had I guess made a bad decision you had a DUI and he had the family and he had people that depended on him and we had to remove them from this position and I was a junior officer at the time and I wasn't charged with with doing the firing so it's kind of weird size you know if someone you go out you have beer with there a drink with than and actually you know you got as far as first so that was hard because you know it's one of those things where are you you really wanted things about the military at you you always hear the stories of where you shouldn't I guess been an officer you shouldn't be so involved with your peers are your subordinates and that's what the thing and it's it was true for me because I I was a cool laid-back kind of guy and and when it's time to make decisions like that their tot interpersonal because you you realize that you're affecting someone to livelihood and and that stuff tell me about yes that's her name of her and in general I've been okay you know not like I've been okay some days are great some days are a crappy but on average there okay now it's not so what I call swing it away not lately I do feel that I do feel that the older I get the older I get I'm just more like you know inpatient about certain things you know just get you know you're you know you think that when you're younger or more impatient it's okay like I can easily is there something I said I better not as I guess I I find that I can get a good night's sleep when when I go to bed at a certain time if I go to bed too early it's it's not good my falculty these are not old all their I need more to become engaged throughout my day and I'm easily distracted I have not I have not I felt really happy I can say last weekend although I did have some down on me but I took my is my wedding anniversary and I took the wife and kids went to Disneyland and I guess it is a happiest place on Earth whatever but really young age where everything is you know you know everything is fun for them so that that makes me happy my mom is been a positive influence in my life I did mention a group in Alabama group in a single-family household and she's always been encouraging and I think when they're so much discouragement around in many different package they have someone that supportive it's always great you know it's always good to have that in your corner because you you going to get it you going to get rejection enough so but to have someone support you and your decisions is always good I think my best friend would probably say that I'm a hard worker have a strong work ethic that I'm generally someone who is responsible and easy-going kind of guy well-liked guy something you did what I'm most proud of I can say that that that makes me happy you know because it's something I think that you're under appreciated sometimes but the I like when my kids now my oldest kid you know wants to show me something you worked on it's cool I mean I think that's great and he's eight and then it's just great and it's good because one day he's going to grow up and he's going to have a kid of his owner of a family of his own and so you know I I think the best thing I can do is give him that example of what it's like to be a dad and to be responsible that's something I never I never had I never saw so I'm kind of it's not like I have a textbook to go back in reference or anything but I think you know it makes me proud because you have little Minds that you're shaping you know a little people that that see what you're doing and and and that kind of want to be like you so that's kind of cool you're welcome goodbye okay with very gradually rising, very trembling, very high, small pitched voice",0
